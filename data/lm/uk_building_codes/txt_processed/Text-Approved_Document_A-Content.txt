LOADING AND GROUND MOVEMENT The Requirements

This Approved Document deals with the following Requirements which are contained in the Building Regulations 2010.

A1/2

Requirement Loading

Limits on application

A1.  (1)  The building shall be constructed so that the combined dead, imposed  and  wind  loads  are  sustained  and  transmitted  by  it  to  the ground:

(a)  safely; and

(b)  without  causing  such  deflection  or  deformation  of  any part of the building, or such movement of the ground, as will impair the stability of any part of another building.

(2)  In assessing whether a building complies with sub-paragraph (1) regard shall be had to the imposed and wind loads to which it is likely to be subjected in the ordinary course of its use for the purpose for which it is intended.

Ground movement

A2.  The  building  shall  be  constructed  so  that  ground  movement caused by:

(a)  swelling, shrinkage or freezing of the subsoil; or

(b)  land-slip  or  subsidence  (other  than  subsidence  arising  from  shrinkage),  in  so  far  as  the  risk  can  be  reasonably  foreseen,  will not impair the stability of any part of the building.

It is important to ensure that the design of the structure takes these factors into account so as to avoid the structure being impaired or causing alarm to people using the structure.

Guidance on the design and testing of grandstands may be found in ‘Dynamic performance requirements for permanent grandstands subject to crowd action – Recommendations for management, design and assessment’ published by The Institution of Structural Engineers, December 2008.

A1/2

Guidance

Introduction 0.1 In the Secretary of State’s view the requirements of A1 and A2 will be met by following the recommendations given in the documents listed in Section 1 or by adopting the guidance in Sections 2-4:

a.  Section 1 is relevant to all building types and lists Codes, Standards and other references for structural design and construction but, where they do not give precise guidance, consideration should be given to paragraph 0.2.

b.  Section 2 give sizes of structural elements for certain residential buildings and other small buildings of traditional construction.

c.  Section 3 gives guidance on the support and fixing of wall cladding.

d.  Section 4 gives guidance where roofs are to be re-covered as a material alteration as defined in the Regulations.

The safety of a structure depends on the 0.2 successful combination of design and completed construction, particularly:

a.  The design should be based on identification of the hazards to which the structure is likely to be subjected and assessment of the risks. The selection of relevant critical situations for design should be made reflecting the conditions that can reasonably be foreseen during future use.

b.  Loading. Dead load, imposed load and wind load should be in accordance with the current Codes of practice referred to in Section 1 of this document.

c.  Properties of materials.

d.  Detailed design and assembly of the structure.

e.  Safety factors.

f.  Workmanship.

The numeric values of safety factors, whether expressed explicitly or implicitly in design equations, or design values, should be derived from considerations of the above aspects of design and construction as a whole. A change in any one of these aspects may disturb the safety of the structure.

Loads used in calculations should allow for possible dynamic, concentrated and peak load effects that may occur.

Ground movement (Requirement A2b)

1.11  There may be known or recorded conditions of ground instability, such as that arising from landslides, disused mines or unstable strata which, if ignored, can have a devastating effect on the safety of a building and its environs. Such conditions should be taken into account in the design of the building and its foundations. Attention is drawn to DOE Planning Policy Guidance Note 14 Development on unstable land (obtainable from The Stationery Office), which sets out the broad planning and technical issues relating to development on unstable land.

The Department has also sponsored a series of reviews aimed at determining the scale and nature of problems arising from mining instability, natural underground cavities and adverse foundation conditions.

Pier A member which forms an integral part of a wall, in the form of a thickened section at intervals along the wall, so as to afford lateral support to the wall to which it is bonded or securely tied.

Separating wall A wall or part of a wall which is common to adjoining buildings, and constructed to meet the requirements of regulation B3(2).

Spacing The distance between the longitudinal centres of any two adjacent timber members of the same type, measured in the plane of floor, ceiling or roof structure.

Span The distance measured along the centre line of a member between the centres of any two adjacent bearings or supports.

Supported wall A wall to which lateral support is afforded by a combination of buttressing walls, piers or chimneys acting in conjunction with floor(s) or roof.

Wind load The load due to the effect of wind pressure or suction.

General

2.1 This section is presented as follows:

Section 2A

Basic requirements for stability.

Section 2B

Sizes of certain timber members in floors and roofs for dwellings.

Areas at risk from house longhorn beetle.

Section 2C

Thickness of masonry walls in certain residential buildings of not more than three storeys, small single-storey non-residential buildings and annexes.

Section 2D

Proportions for masonry chimneys.

Section 2E

Foundations of plain concrete.

Section 2A gives general rules which must 2.2 be observed in following Sections 2B and 2C. Sections 2B to 2E may be used independently of each other.

Throughout this section the diagrams are only illustrative and do not show all the details of construction.

Definitions

2.3 throughout this section:

The following meanings apply to terms Buttressing wall A wall designed and constructed to afford lateral support to another wall perpendicular to it, support being provided from the base to the top of the wall.

Cavity width The horizontal distance between the two leaves of a cavity wall.

Compartment wall A wall constructed as a compartment wall to meet the requirements of regulation B3(2).

Dead load The load due to the weight of all walls, permanent partitions, floors, roofs and finishes including services, and all other permanent construction.

Structure Approved Document AONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONSection 2A: Basic requirements for stability

A1/2

2A1  This section must be used in conjunction with sections 2B and 2C and its principles relate to all forms of low-rise residential buildings.

2A2  Adequate provision shall be made to ensure that the building is stable under the likely imposed and wind loading conditions. This will commonly necessitate meeting the following requirements:

a.  That the overall size and proportioning of the building are limited in accordance with the specific guidance for each form of construction.

b.  That a suitable layout of walls (both internal and external) forming a robust 3 dimensional box structure in plan is constructed with restriction on the maximum size of cells measured in accordance with the specific guidance for each form of construction. c.  That the internal and external walls are adequately connected either by masonry bonding or by using mechanical connections.

d.  That the intermediate floors and roof are of such construction and interconnection with the walls that they provide local support to the walls and also act as horizontal diaphragms capable of transferring the wind forces to buttressing elements of the building.

Note: A traditional cut timber roof (i.e. using rafters, purlins and ceiling joists) generally has sufficient built in resistance to instability and wind forces (e.g. from hipped ends, tiling battens, rigid sarking or the like). However, the need for diagonal rafter bracing equivalent to that recommended in BS EN 1995-1-1:2004 with its UK National Annex and additional guidance given in BSI Published Document PD 6693-1:2012 and BS 8103-3:2009 for trussed rafter roofs should be considered, especially for single-hipped and non-hipped roofs of greater than 40° pitch to detached houses.

A1/2

Application

2C1  This section applies to the following building types:

a.  residential buildings of not more than three storeys;

b.  small single-storey non-residential buildings;

c.  small buildings forming annexes to residential buildings (including garages and outbuildings).

Wall types

2C2  Only the types of wall given in Table 2, which must extend to the full storey height, and parapet walls are considered in this section.

The use of this section

2C3  When using this section it should be noted that:

a.  this section must be used in conjunction with section 2A;

b.  if wall thickness is to be determined according to paragraphs 2C5 to 2C13, all appropriate design conditions given in this section must be satisfied;

c.  walls should comply with the relevant requirements of BS EN 1996-2:2006 with its UK National Annex and additional guidance given in BSI Published Document PD 6697:2010, except as regards the conditions given in paragraphs 2C4 and 2C14 to 2C38;

d.  in formulating the guidance of this section the worst combination of circumstances likely to arise was taken into account. If a requirement of this part is considered too onerous in a particular case it may be appropriate to consider a minor departure on the basis of judgement and experience, or to show adequacy by calculation in respect of the aspect of the wall which is subject to the departure rather than for the entire wall;

e.  the guidance given is based upon the compressive strengths of bricks and blocks being not less than indicated in Tables 6 and 7.

BS EN 1996-1-1:2005 with its UK National Annex gives design strengths for walls where the suitability for use of masonry units of other compressive strengths is being considered.

Conditions relating to the building of which the wall forms part

2C4  This section applies only to buildings having proportions within the following parameters (see Diagrams 1 and 2):

a.  residential buildings of not more than three storeys:

i. the maximum height of the building measured from the lowest finished ground level adjoining the building to the highest point of any wall or roof should not be greater than 15m, subject to the limits of paragraph 2C16;

ii.  the height of the building H should not exceed twice the least width of the building W1;

iii.  the height of the wing H2 should not exceed twice the least width of the wing W2 where the projection P exceeds twice the width W2;

b.  small single-storey non-residential buildings: height H should not exceed 3m and W (being the greatest length or width of the building) should not exceed 9m (see Diagram 2), subject to the limits of paragraph 2C16;

c.  annexes: height H as variously indicated in Diagram 2 should not exceed 3m, subject to the limits of paragraph 2C16.

The wall ties should have a horizontal spacing of 900mm and a vertical spacing of 450mm, or alternatively should be spaced such that the number of wall ties per square metre is not less than 2.5 ties/m2. Wall ties should also be provided, spaced not more than 300mm apart vertically, within a distance of 225mm from the vertical edges of all openings, movement joints and roof verges. For selection of wall ties for use in a range of cavity widths refer to Table 5. For specification of cavity wall ties refer to paragraph 2C19.

For external walls, compartment walls and separating walls in cavity construction, the combined thickness of the two leaves plus 10mm should not be less than the thickness determined by paragraph 2C6 and Table 3 for a solid wall of the same height and length.

2C9  Walls providing vertical support to other walls: Irrespective of the material used in the construction, a wall should not be less in thickness than any part of the wall to which it gives vertical support.

2C10  Internal load-bearing walls in brickwork or blockwork (except compartment walls or separating walls): All internal load-bearing walls should have a thickness not less than:   (specified thickness from Table 3) 2

Conditions relating to the ground

2E1  There should not be:

a.  non-engineered fill (as described in BRE Digest 427) or wide variation in ground conditions within the loaded area; nor

b.  weaker or more compressible ground at such a depth below the foundation as could impair the stability of the structure.

Design provisions

2E2  The following design provisions relate to foundations:

a.  the foundations should be situated centrally under the wall;

b.  for foundations in chemically aggressive soil conditions guidance in BS 8500-1 and BRE Special Digest 1 should be followed. In non-aggressive soils, concrete should be composed of Portland cement to BS EN 197-1 and -2 and fine and coarse aggregate conforming to BS EN 12620 and the mix should comply with one of the following recommendations:

i. in proportion of 50kg of Portland cement to not more than 200kg (0.1m3) of fine aggregate and 400kg (0.2m3) of coarse aggregate; or

ii.  grade ST2 or grade GEN I concrete to  BS 8500-2;

c.  minimum thickness T of concrete foundation should be 150mm or P, whichever is the greater, where P is derived using Table 10 and Diagram 23. Trench fill foundations may be used as an acceptable alternative to strip foundations;

d.  foundations stepped on elevation should overlap by twice the height of the step, by the thickness of the foundation, or 300mm, whichever is greater (see Diagram 21).

For trench fill foundations the overlap should be twice the height of the step or 1m, whichever is greater;

e.  steps in foundations should not be of greater height than the thickness of the foundation (see Diagram 21);

f. foundations for piers, buttresses and chimneys should project as indicated in Diagram 22 and the projection X should never be less than the value of P where there is no local thickening of the wall.

Minimum width of strip foundations

2E3  The recommended minimum widths of foundations given in Table 10 may be used.

The table is applicable only within the strict terms of the criteria described within it.

Minimum depth of strip foundations

2E4  Except where strip foundations are founded on rock, the strip foundations should have a minimum depth of 0.45m to their underside to avoid the action of frost. This depth, however, will commonly need to be increased in areas subject to long periods of frost or in order to transfer the loading onto satisfactory ground.

In clay soils subject to volume change on drying (‘shrinkable clays’, with Modified Plasticity Index greater than or equal to 10%), strip foundations should be taken to a depth where anticipated ground movements will not impair the stability of any part of the building taking due consideration of the influence of vegetation and trees on the ground. The depth to the underside of foundations on clay soils should not be less than 0.75m on low shrinkage clay soils, 0.9m on medium shrinkage clay soils and 1.0m on high shrinkage clay soils, although these depths may need to be increased in order to transfer the loading onto satisfactory ground, or where there are trees nearby.

vehicle barrier, then account should be taken of the additional imposed loading, as stipulated in Approved Document K, Protection from falling, collision and impact.

3.6   Where the wall cladding is required to safely withstand lateral pressures from crowds, an appropriate design loading is given in BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 with its UK National Annex and the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (4th Edition, 1997).

The selection of fixings for supporting Fixings

3.7 cladding should be determined from a consideration of the proven performance of the fixing and the risks associated with the particular application. In this regard applications should be designated as being either non-redundant (where the failure of a single fixing could lead to the detachment of the cladding) or redundant (where failure or excessive movement of one fixing results in load sharing by adjacent fixings) and the required reliability of the fixing determined accordingly.

Note: Attention is drawn to the availability of anchors with an ETA gained in accordance with the requirements of ETAG 001 Guideline for European Technical Approval Metal Anchors for use in Concrete Parts 1-5, which cover both redundant and non-redundant applications, and Part 6 which covers ‘Anchors for multiple use in non-structural applications’ and which can effectively be regarded as covering redundant use. The UK definition of ‘multiple use’ is contained in an annexe to ETAG Part 6 and is framed in such a way that all applications can be validated as to whether or not they conform to this category without calculation. All ETAG parts may be downloaded in English from www.eota.be.

3.8 The strength of fixings should be derived from tests using materials representative of the material into which the fixing is to be anchored, taking account of any inherent weaknesses that may affect the strength of the fixing, e.g. cracks in concrete due to shrinkage and flexure, or voids in masonry construction. The design loads will generally be available from the manufacturer’s test data determined from an ETA or an extant British Standard.

Note: ETAs are available which cover use either in both cracked and non-cracked concrete or in non-cracked concrete only. Those which cover both cracked and non-cracked concrete allow higher loads for use in non-cracked than in cracked concrete. General

3.1  Wall cladding presents a hazard if it becomes detached from the building. This section provides guidance on the support and fixing of wall cladding. An acceptable level of safety can be achieved by different means depending on the type and location of the cladding. The guidance given relates to all forms of cladding, including curtain walling and glass facades. It is not intended to provide guidance concerning the weather resistance of wall cladding which is included in Approved Document C, Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture, or guidance on resistance to spread of fire which is included in Approved Document B, Fire safety, or guidance in relation to sound insulation, which is included in Approved Document E, Resistance to the passage of sound.

Technical approach

3.2 requirement if:

The cladding will meet the safety a.  the cladding is capable of safely sustaining and transmitting to the supporting structure of the building all dead, imposed and wind loads, and

b.  the cladding is securely fixed to and supported by the structure of the building. This shall comprise both vertical support and horizontal restraint, and

c.  provision is made, where necessary, to accommodate differential movement of the cladding and the supporting structure of the building, and

d.  the cladding and its fixings (including any support components) are of durable materials; the design life of the fixings being not less than that of the cladding. Fixings shall be corrosion resistant and of a material type appropriate for the local environment.

Loading

3.3  Wind loading on the cladding should be derived from BS EN 1991-1-4:2005 with its UK National Annex with due consideration given to local increases in wind suction arising from funnelling of the wind through gaps between buildings.

3.4  Where the cladding is required to support other fixtures, e.g. handrails, and fittings, e.g. antennae and signboards, account should be taken of the loads and forces arising from such fixtures and fittings.

3.5  Where the wall cladding is required to function as pedestrian guarding to stairs, ramps, vertical drops of more than 600mm in dwellings or more than the height of two risers (or 380mm if not part of a stair) in other buildings, or as a 38

Section 4: Roof covering

Materials

4.1 All materials used to cover roofs, excluding windows of glass in residential buildings with roof pitches of not less than 15°, shall be capable of safely withstanding the concentrated imposed loads upon roofs specified in BS EN 1991-1-

1:2002 with its UK National Annex. Transparent or translucent covering materials for roofs not accessible except for normal maintenance and repair are excluded from the requirement to carry the concentrated imposed load upon roofs if they are non-fragile or are otherwise suitably protected against collapse.

The re-covering of roofs is commonly Re-covering of roofs

4.2 undertaken to extend the useful life of buildings. Roof structures may be required to carry underdrawing or insulation provided at a time later than their initial construction. This section provides guidance on determining whether such work to a roof constitutes a material alteration under the Building Regulations.

4.3  Where the work involves a significant change in the applied loading the structural integrity of the roof structure and the supporting structure should be checked to ensure that upon completion of the work the building is not less compliant with Requirement A1 than the original building.

A significant change in roof loading is 4.4 when the loading upon the roof is increased by more than 15%. Consideration might also be given to whether the roof covering being replaced is the original as-built covering.

4.5  Where such checking of the existing roof structure indicates that the construction is unable to sustain any proposed increase in loading (e.g. due to overstressed members or unacceptable deflection leading to ponding), appropriate strengthening work or replacement of roofing members should be undertaken. This is classified as a material alteration.

In carrying out the checks mentioned in 4.6 paragraph 4.3 an increase of stress in a structural member arising from increased loading does not necessarily indicate that the roof structure is less compliant than the original roof provided an adequate factor of safety is maintained. 4.7  Where work will significantly decrease the roof dead loading, the roof structure and its anchorage to the supporting structure should be checked to ensure that an adequate factor of safety is maintained against uplift of the roof under imposed wind loading.

The guidance in Section 5 deals with the 42

Structure Approved Document AONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONA3

Section 5: Reducing the sensitivity of the building to disproportionate collapse in the event of an accident

5.1   The requirement will be met by adopting the following approach for ensuring that the building is sufficiently robust to sustain a limited extent of damage or failure, depending on the consequence class of the building, without collapse.

a.   Determine the building’s consequence class from Table 11.

b.  For Consequence Class 1 buildings – Provided the building has been designed and constructed in accordance with the rules given in this Approved Document, or other guidance referenced under Section 1, for meeting compliance with Requirement A1 and A2 in normal use, no additional measures are likely to be necessary.

c.  For Consequence Class 2a buildings – In addition to the Consequence Class 1 measures, provide effective horizontal ties, or effective anchorage of suspended floors to walls, as described in the Standards listed under paragraph 5.2 for framed and load-

bearing wall construction (the latter being defined in paragraph 5.3 below).

d.  For Consequence Class 2b buildings – In addition to the Consequence Class 1 measures, provide effective horizontal ties, as described in the Standards listed under paragraph 5.2 for framed and load-bearing wall construction (the latter being defined in paragraph 5.3 below), together with effective vertical ties, as defined in the Standards listed under paragraph 5.2, in all supporting columns and walls.

Alternatively, check that upon the notional removal of each supporting column and each beam supporting one or more columns, or any nominal length of load-bearing wall (one at a time in each storey of the building), the building remains stable and that the area of floor at any storey at risk of collapse does not exceed 15% of the floor area of that storey or 100m2, whichever is smaller, and does not extend further than the immediate adjacent storeys (see Diagram 24).

Critical situations for design should be selected that reflect the conditions that can reasonably be foreseen as possible during the life of the building. The structural form and concept and any protective measures should then be chosen and the detailed design of the structure and its elements undertaken in accordance with the recommendations given in the Standards given in paragraph 5.2.

Further guidance is given in Annexes A and B to BS EN 1991-1-7:2006 Eurocode 1: Actions on structures – Part 1.7: General actions – Accidental actions; with UK National Annex to BS EN 1991-1-7:2006 and BS EN 1990:2002+A1:2005 Eurocode – Basis of structural design; with UK National Annex to  BS EN 1990:2002+A1:2005.

5.2   Details of the effective horizontal and vertical ties including tie force determination, together with the design approaches for checking the integrity of the building following the notional removal of vertical members and the design of key elements, are given in the following Standards:

5.3  Definitions

Nominal length of load-bearing wall

The nominal length of load-bearing wall construction referred to in 5.1d should be taken as follows:

− −   in the case of a reinforced concrete wall, the distance between lateral supports subject to a maximum length not exceeding 2.25H,

  in the case of an external masonry wall, or timber or steel stud wall, the length measured between vertical lateral supports,

−   in the case of an internal masonry wall, or timber or steel stud wall, a length not exceeding 2.25H,

where H is the storey height in metres.

Note: Annex A of BS EN 1991-1-7:2006 with its UK National Annex provides corresponding guidance.

key elements

A ‘key element’, as referred to in paragraph 5.1d, should be capable of sustaining an accidental design loading of 34kN/m2 applied in the horizontal and vertical directions (in one direction at a time) to the member and any attached components (e.g. cladding etc.) having regard to the ultimate strength of such components and their connections. Such accidental design loading should be assumed to act simultaneously with all other design loadings (i.e. wind and imposed loading) in accidental actions loading combination.

Note: Annex A of BS EN 1991-1-7:2006 with its UK National Annex provides corresponding guidance for ‘key elements’.

Load-bearing construction

For the purposes of this Guidance the term ‘load-

bearing wall construction’ includes masonry cross-wall construction and walls comprising close centred timber or lightweight steel section studs.

Alternative approach

5.4   As an alternative to Table 11, for any building which does not fall into the classes listed under Table 11, or for which the consequences of collapse may warrant particular examination of the risks involved, performance may be demonstrated using the recommendations given in the following Reports and Publication:

Seismic design

5.5   Seismic design is not usually required for buildings classified by Table 11 as being in Consequence Classes 1, 2a and 2b. For buildings classified as Consequence Class 3 the risk assessment should consider if there is any need to carry out seismic design, although such a need is not an explicit requirement for these buildings.
