Section 1: Fire detection and alarm systems

General provisions

1.1  All dwellings should have a fire detection and alarm system, minimum Grade D2 Category LD3 standard, in accordance with the relevant recommendations of BS 5839-6.

A higher standard of protection should be considered where occupants of a proposed dwelling would be at special risk from fire. Further advice on this is also given in BS 5839-6.

1.2  Smoke alarms should be mains operated and conform to BS EN 14604.

1.3  Heat alarms should be mains operated and conform to BS 5446-2.

1.4  Smoke and heat alarms should have a standby power supply, such as a battery (rechargeable or non-rechargeable) or capacitor. More information on power supplies is given in clause 15 of BS 5839-6.

NOTE: The term ‘fire alarm system’ describes the combination of components for giving an audible and/or other perceptible warning of fire. NOTE: In this document, the term ‘fire detection system’ describes any type of automatic sensor network and associated control and indicating equipment. Sensors may be sensitive to smoke, heat, gaseous combustion products or radiation. Automatic sprinkler systems can also be used to operate a fire alarm system.

Large dwellinghouses

1.5  A large dwellinghouse has more than one storey, and at least one storey exceeds 200m2.

1.6  A large dwellinghouse of two storeys (excluding basement storeys) should be fitted with a Grade A Category LD3 fire detection and alarm system, as described in BS 5839-6.

1.7  A large dwellinghouse of three or more storeys (excluding basement storeys) should be fitted with a Grade A Category LD2 fire detection and alarm system as described in BS 5839-6.

Extensions and material alterations

1.8  A fire detection and alarm system should be installed where either of the  following applies. a.  A new habitable room is provided above or below the ground storey. b.  A new habitable room is provided at the ground storey, without a final exit. 1.9  Smoke alarms should be provided in the circulation spaces of the dwelling in accordance with paragraphs 1.1 to 1.4.

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONBlocks of flats

1.10  Each flat in a block should have alarms as set out in paragraphs 1.1 to 1.4. With effective compartmentation, a communal fire alarm system is not normally needed. In some buildings, detectors in common parts of the building may need to operate smoke control or other fire protection systems but do not usually sound an audible warning. Student accommodation

1.11 In student residences that are designed and occupied as a block of flats, separate automatic detection should be provided in each self-contained flat where all of the following apply.

a.  A group of up to six students shares the flat.

b.  Each flat has its own entrance door.

c.  The compartmentation principles for flats in Section 7 have been followed.

Where a total evacuation strategy is adopted, the alarm system should follow the guidance for buildings other than dwellings in Volume 2 of Approved Document B.

Sheltered housing

1.12  The fire detection and alarm systems in flats should connect to a central monitoring point or alarm receiving centre. The systems should alert the warden or supervisor and identify the individual flat where a fire has been detected. 1.13  These provisions do not apply to the following. a.  The common parts of a sheltered housing development, such as communal lounges.

b.  Sheltered accommodation in the 'residential (institutional)' or 'residential (other)' purpose groups  (purpose group 2(a) or 2(b)). In these parts, means of warning should follow the guidance for buildings other than dwellings in Volume 2 of Approved Document B.

Design and installation of systems

1.14  Fire detection and alarm systems must be properly designed, installed and maintained. A design, installation and commissioning certificate should be provided for fire detection and alarm systems. Third party certification schemes for fire protection products and related services are an effective means of providing assurances of quality, reliability and safety.

Interface between fire detection and alarm systems and other systems

1.15  Fire detection and alarm systems sometimes trigger other systems. The interface between systems must be reliable. Particular care should be taken if the interface is facilitated via another system. Where any part of BS 7273 applies to the triggering of other systems, the recommendations of that part of BS 7273 should be followed.

Introduction

3.1  Separate guidance applies to means of escape within the flat and within the common parts of the building that lead to a place of safety. Flats at ground level are treated similarly to dwellinghouses. With increasing height, more complex provisions are needed.

3.2  The provisions in this section make the following assumptions.

a.  Any fire is likely to be in a flat.

b.  There is no reliance on external rescue.

c.  Simultaneous evacuation of all flats is unlikely to be necessary due to compartmentation. d.  Fires in common parts of the building should not spread beyond the fabric in the immediate vicinity. In some cases, however, communal facilities exist that require additional measures to be taken. 3.3  Provisions are recommended to support a stay put evacuation strategy for blocks of flats. It is based on the principle that a fire is contained in the flat of origin and common escape routes are maintained relatively free from smoke and heat. It allows occupants, some of whom may require assistance to escape in the event of a fire, in other flats that are not affected to remain.

Sufficient protection to common means of escape is necessary to allow occupants to escape should they choose to do so or are instructed/aided to by the fire service. A higher standard of protection is therefore needed to ensure common escape routes remain available for a longer period than is provided in other buildings.

3.4  Paragraphs 3.6 to 3.23 deal with the means of escape within each flat. Paragraphs 3.25 to 3.89 deal with the means of escape in common areas of the building (including mixed use buildings in paragraphs 3.76 and 3.77). Guidance for live/work units is given in paragraph 3.24.

General provisions

Mixed use buildings

3.5 In mixed use buildings, separate means of escape should be provided from any storeys or parts of storeys used for the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose groups 1, 2 and 5), other than in the case of certain small buildings or buildings in which the residential accommodation is ancillary (see paragraphs 3.76 and 3.77)

Emergency escape windows and external doors

3.6  Windows or external doors providing emergency escape should comply with all of the following.

a.  Windows should have an unobstructed openable area that complies with all of the following. i. A minimum area of 0.33m2.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition 19

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONii.  A minimum height of 450mm and a minimum width of 450mm (the route through the window may be at an angle rather than straight through).

iii.  The bottom of the openable area is a maximum of 1100mm above the floor.

b.  People escaping should be able to reach a place free from danger from fire.

c.  Locks (with or without removable keys) and opening stays (with child-resistant release catches) may be fitted to escape windows.

3.10  Where a flat roof forms part of a means of escape, it should comply with all of the following.

a. It should be part of the same building from which escape is being made.

b.  The route across the roof should lead to a storey exit or external escape route.

c.  The part of the roof (including its supporting structure) forming the escape route, and any opening within 3m of the escape route, should be of fire resisting construction (minimum  REI 30).

3.11  A balcony or flat roof intended to form part of an escape route should be provided with guarding etc. in accordance with Approved Document K.

3.12  For flats more than 4.5m above ground level, a balcony outside an alternative exit should be a common balcony meeting the conditions described in paragraph 3.22.

Internal planning of multi‑storey flats

3.20  A multi-storey flat with an independent external entrance at ground level is similar to a dwellinghouse and means of escape should be planned on the basis of Section 2, depending on the height of the top storey above ground level. 3.21  When multi-storey flats do not have their own external entrance at ground level, adopt one of the following approaches. a.  Approach 1 – provide at least one alternative exit from each habitable room that is not on the entrance storey of the flat (Diagram 3.5 and paragraph 3.22).

b.  Approach 2 – provide at least one alternative exit from each storey that is not the entrance storey of the flat. All habitable rooms should have direct access to a protected landing  (Diagram 3.6 and paragraph 3.22).

c.  Approach 3 – provide a protected stairway plus a sprinkler system in accordance with  Appendix E (smoke alarms should also be provided in accordance with Section 1). d.  Approach 4 – if the vertical distance between the entrance storey of the flat and any of the storeys above or below does not exceed 7.5m, provide all of the following.

3.22  Any alternative exit from a flat should comply with all of the following.

It should be remote from the main entrance door to the flat. a. b. It should lead to a final exit, via a common stair if necessary, through one of the following.

i. A door to an access corridor, access lobby or common balcony.

ii.  An internal private stair leading to an access corridor, access lobby or common balcony at another level.

iii.  A door to a common stair.

iv.  A door to an external stair.

v.  A door to an escape route over a flat roof.

Any access route leading to a final exit or common stair should comply with the provisions for means of escape in the common parts of a flat (see paragraph 3.25).

Air circulation systems in flats with a protected stairway or entrance hall enclosure

3.23  For systems circulating air only within an individual flat, take all of the following precautions.

a.  Transfer grilles should not be fitted in any wall, door, floor or ceiling of the enclosure.

b.  Any duct passing through the enclosure should be rigid steel. Joints between the ductwork and enclosure should be fire-stopped.

c.  Ventilation ducts serving the enclosure should not serve any other areas.

d.  Any system of mechanical ventilation which recirculates air and which serves both the stair and other areas should be designed to shut down on the detection of smoke within the system.

e.  For ducted warm air heating systems, a room thermostat should be sited in the living room. It should be mounted at a height between 1370mm and 1830mm above the floor. The maximum setting should be 27°C.

NOTE: Ventilation ducts passing through compartment walls should comply with the guidance in Section 9.

Live/work units

3.24  For flats serving as a workplace for both occupants and people who do not live on the premises, provide both of the following.  a.  A maximum travel distance of 18m between any part of the working area and either of the following. i. The flat entrance door. ii.  An alternative means of escape that is not a window. If the travel distance is over 18m, the assumptions in paragraph 3.2 may not be valid. The design should be considered on a case-by-case basis. b.  Escape lighting to windowless accommodation in accordance with BS 5266-1.  Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition 25

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONMeans of escape in the common parts of flats

3.25  The following paragraphs deal with means of escape from the entrance doors of flats to a final exit. They do not apply to flats with a top storey that is a maximum of 4.5m above ground level (designed in accordance with paragraphs 3.15 to 3.17).

Reference should also be made to the following.

a.  Requirement B3 regarding compartment walls and protected shafts. b.  Requirement B5 regarding access for the fire and rescue service.

Number of escape routes

3.26  A person escaping through the common area, if confronted by the effects of a fire in another flat, should be able to turn away from it and make a safe escape via an alternative route.

3.27  From the flat entrance door, a single escape route is acceptable in either of the following cases.

a.  The flat is on a storey served by a single common stair and both of the following apply.

i. Every flat is separated from the common stair by a protected lobby or common protected corridor (see Diagram 3.7).

ii.  The maximum travel distance in Table 3.1, for escape in one direction only, is not exceeded.

b.  The flat is in a dead end of a common corridor served by two (or more) common stairs and the maximum travel distance given in Table 3.1, for escape in one direction only, is not exceeded (Diagram 3.8).

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONEscape routes over flat roofs

3.30  Where a storey or part of a building has multiple escape routes available, one may be over a flat roof that complies with all of the following.

a. It should be part of the same building from which escape is being made.

b.  The route across the roof should lead to a storey exit or external escape route.

c.  The part of the roof (including its supporting structure) forming the escape route, and any opening within 3m of the escape route, should be of fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30).

d.  The route should be clearly defined and guarded by walls and/or protective barriers to protect against falling.

Common escape routes 3.31  The following paragraphs deal with means of escape from the entrance doors of flats to a final exit. 3.32  Escape route travel distances should comply with Table 3.1. 3.33  An escape route should not pass through one stair enclosure to reach another. It may pass through a protected lobby (minimum REI 30) of one stair to reach another.

3.34  Common corridors should be protected corridors. The wall between each flat and the corridor should be a compartment wall (minimum REI 30 where the top storey is up to 5m above ground level, otherwise REI 60).

3.35  Divide a common corridor connecting two or more storey exits with a fire doorset fitted with a self-closing device (minimum E 30 Sa). See Diagram 3.8. Associated screens should be fire resisting. Site doors so that smoke does not affect access to more than one stair.

3.36  A fire doorset (minimum E 30 Sa) fitted with a self-closing device (and fire resisting screen, where required) should separate the dead-end portion of a common corridor from the rest of the corridor (Diagrams 3.7a, 3.8b and 3.8c).

3.37  Ancillary accommodation should not be located in, or entered from, a protected lobby or protected corridor forming the only common escape route on that storey. Headroom in common escape routes

3.38  Escape routes should have a minimum clear headroom of 2m. The only projections allowed below this height are door frames.

Flooring of common escape routes

3.39  Escape route floor finishes should minimise their slipperiness when wet. Finishes include the treads of steps and surfaces of ramps and landings.

Ramps and sloping floors 3.40  A ramp forming part of an escape route should meet the provisions in Approved Document M. Any sloping floor or tier should have a pitch of not more than 35 degrees to the horizontal. Lighting of common escape routes

3.41  Except for two storey blocks of flats, all escape routes should have adequate artificial lighting. If the mains electricity power supply fails, escape lighting should illuminate the route (including external escape routes).

30  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION3.42  In addition, escape lighting should be provided to all of the following. a.  Toilet accommodation with a minimum floor area of 8m2.

b.  Electricity and generator rooms.

c.  Switch room/battery room for emergency lighting system.

d.  Emergency control rooms.

3.43  Escape stair lighting should be on a separate circuit from the electricity supply to any other part of the escape route.

3.44  Escape lighting should conform to BS 5266-1.

Exit signs on common escape routes

3.45  Every doorway or other exit providing access to a means of escape, other than exits in ordinary use (e.g. main entrances), should be distinctively and conspicuously marked by an exit sign in accordance with BS ISO 3864-1 and BS 5499-4. For this reason, blocks of flats with a single stair in regular use would not usually require any fire exit signage.

Advice on fire safety signs, including emergency escape signs, is given in the HSE publication Safety Signs and Signals: Guidance on Regulations.

Some buildings may require additional signs to comply with other legislation.

Protected power circuits

3.46  To limit potential damage to cables in protected circuits, all of the following should apply.

a.  Cables should be sufficiently robust.

b.  Cable routes should be carefully selected and/or physically protected in areas where cables may be exposed to damage.

c.  Methods of cable support should be class A1 rated and offer at least the same integrity as the cable. They should maintain circuit integrity and hold cables in place when exposed to fire. 3.47  A protected circuit to operate equipment during a fire should achieve all of the following.

a.  Cables should achieve PH 30 classification when tested in accordance with BS EN 50200 (incorporating Annex E) or an equivalent standard.

b. It should only pass through parts of the building in which the fire risk is negligible. c. It should be separate from any circuit provided for another purpose.

3.48  Guidance on cables for large and complex buildings is given in BS 5839-1, BS 5266-1 and BS 8519.

Smoke control in common escape routes

3.49  Despite the provisions described, it is probable that some smoke will get into the common corridor or lobby from a fire in a flat. There should therefore be some means of ventilating the common corridors/lobbies to control smoke and so protect the common stairs. This means of ventilation offers additional protection to that provided by the fire doors to the stair, as well as some protection to the corridors/lobbies. Ventilation can be natural (paragraphs 3.50 to 3.53) or mechanical (paragraph 3.54).

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition 31

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONSmoke control of common escape routes by natural smoke ventilation

3.50  Except in buildings that comply with Diagram 3.9, the corridor or lobby next to each stair should have a smoke vent. The location of the vent should comply with both of the following.

a.  Be as high as practicable.

b.  Be positioned so the top edge is at least as high as the top of the door to the stair.

3.51  Smoke vents should comply with one of the following.

a.  They should be located on an external wall with minimum free area of 1.5m2.

b.  They should discharge into a vertical smoke shaft, closed at the base, that meets all of the following criteria.

i. The shaft should conform to the following conditions.

•  Have a minimum cross-sectional area of 1.5m2 (minimum dimension 0.85m in any direction).

•  Open at roof level, minimum 0.5m above any surrounding structures within 2m of it horizontally.

•  Extend a minimum of 2.5m above the ceiling of the highest storey served by the shaft.

ii.  The free area of all the following vents should be a minimum of 1m2 in the following places.

•  From the corridor or lobby into the shaft.

•  At the opening at the head of the shaft.

•  At all internal locations within the shaft (e.g. safety grilles).

iii.  The smoke shaft should be constructed from a class A1 material. All vents should either be a smoke leakage (Sa) rated fire doorset (see Appendix C, Table C1, item 2.e for minimum fire resistance) or fitted with a smoke control damper achieving the same period of fire resistance and designed to operate as described below. The shaft should be vertical from base to head, with a maximum of 4m at a maximum inclined angle of 30 degrees.

iv. If smoke is detected in the common corridor or lobby, both of the following should occur.

•  Simultaneous opening of vents on the storey where the fire is located, at the top of the smoke shaft and to the stair. •  Vents from the corridors or lobbies on all other storeys should remain closed, even if smoke is subsequently detected on storeys other than where the fire is located.

3.52  A vent to the outside with a minimum free area of 1m2 should be provided from the top storey of the stair.

3.53  In single stair buildings, smoke vents on the storey where the fire is initiated, and the vent at the head of the stair, should be activated by smoke detectors in the common parts.

In buildings with more than one stair, smoke vents may be activated manually. The control system should open the vent at the head of the stair before, or at the same time as, the vent on the storey where the fire is located. Smoke detection is not required for ventilation purposes in this instance. Smoke control of common escape routes by mechanical ventilation

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONRefuse chutes and storage

3.55  Refuse storage chambers, refuse chutes and refuse hoppers should be sited and constructed in accordance with BS 5906.

3.56  Refuse chutes and rooms for storing refuse should meet both of the following conditions.

a.  Be separated from other parts of the building by fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30 in buildings with a top storey up to 5m above ground level; otherwise REI 60).

b.  Not be situated within a protected stairway or protected lobby.

3.57  The approach to rooms containing refuse chutes or for storing refuse should comply with one of the following conditions. a.  Be directly from the open air.

b.  Be through a protected lobby with a minimum of 0.2m2 of permanent ventilation.

3.58  Access openings to refuse storage chambers should not be sited in the following areas.

a.  Next to escape routes or final exits.

b.  Near the windows of flats.

Common stairs

Number of common stairs

3.59  A building should provide access to more than one common stair if it does not meet the criteria for a single common stair (see paragraph 3.26 and 3.27). Width of common stairs

3.60  A stair of acceptable width for everyday use will be sufficient for escape purposes. If it is also a firefighting stair, it should be at least 1100mm wide. The width is the clear width between the walls or balustrades. Any handrails and strings intruding into that width by a maximum of 100mm on each side may be ignored. Protection of common stairs

3.61  Section 7 provides guidance on avoiding the spread of fire between storeys. For a stair that is also a firefighting stair, guidance in Section 15 should be followed. Enclosure of common stairs

3.62  Every common stair should be a protected stairway. Where the protected stairway passes from one compartment to another, it should be within a protected shaft. External walls adjacent to protected stairways

3.63  With some configurations of external wall, a fire in one part of a building could subject the external wall of a protected stairway to heat (for example, where the two are adjacent at an internal angle in the façade, as shown in Diagram 3.10).

3.64  If a protected stairway projects beyond, is recessed from or is in an internal angle of the adjoining external wall of the building, then the minimum distance between an unprotected area of the building enclosure and an unprotected area of the stair enclosure should be 1800mm.

c.  Fire resisting construction (minimum RE 30) should be provided for any part of the building (including doors) within 1800mm of the escape route from the foot of the stair to a place of safety. This does not apply if there are alternative escape routes from the foot of the external escape stair.

d.  Glazing in areas of fire resisting construction should be fixed shut and fire resisting (in terms of integrity but not insulation) (minimum E 30). e.  Stairs more than 6m in height above ground level (e.g. where they are provided above a podium) should be protected from adverse weather. Protection should prevent the build-up of snow or ice but does not require full enclosure. 3.69  Access to an external escape stair may be via a flat roof, provided the flat roof meets the requirements of paragraph 3.30.

Separation of adjoining protected stairways

3.70  The construction separating two adjacent protected stairways (or exit passageways leading to different final exits) should be imperforate.

Basement stairs

3.71  If a building does not meet the criteria of paragraph 3.28, an escape stair forming part of the only escape route from an upper storey should not continue down to serve a basement storey. The basement storey should be served by a separate escape stair.

3.72  Where multiple escape stairs serve the upper storeys, only one needs to end at ground level. Other stairs may connect with the basement storeys if there is a protected lobby or a protected corridor between the stairs and accommodation at each basement level.

Stairs serving ancillary accommodation

3.73  Except in buildings described in paragraph 3.28, common stairs forming part of the only escape route from a flat should not serve any of the following. a.  Covered car park.

b.  Boiler room.

c.  Fuel storage space.

d.  Other ancillary accommodation of similar fire risk.

3.74  Where a common stair is not part of the only escape route from a flat, it may also serve ancillary accommodation from which it is separated by a protected lobby or protected corridor (minimum REI 30).

3.75  Where a stair serves an enclosed car park or place of special fire hazard, the lobby or corridor should have a minimum 0.4m2 of permanent ventilation or be protected from the ingress of smoke by a mechanical smoke control system. NOTE: For refuse chutes and storage see paragraphs 3.55 to 3.58.

This section deals with the following requirement from Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.

Limits on application

Requirement

Requirement

Internal fire spread (linings)

B2. (1)   To inhibit the spread of fire within the building, the internal linings shall—

 (a)   adequately resist the spread of flame over their surfaces; and

 (b)   have, if ignited, either a rate of heat release or a rate of fire growth, which is reasonable in the circumstances.

(2)   In this paragraph “internal linings” means the materials or products used in lining any partition, wall, ceiling or other internal structure.

Intention

In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B2 is met by achieving a restricted spread of flame over internal linings. The building fabric should make a limited contribution to fire growth, including a low rate of heat release.

It is particularly important in circulation spaces, where linings may offer the main means by which fire spreads and where rapid spread is most likely to prevent occupants from escaping.

Requirement B2 does not include guidance on the following.

a.  Generation of smoke and fumes.

b.  The upper surfaces of floors and stairs.

c.  Furniture and fittings.

Requirement

Requirement

Internal fire spread (structure)

B3. (1)   The building shall be designed and constructed so that, in the event of fire, its stability will be maintained for a reasonable period

(2)   A wall common to two or more buildings shall be designed and constructed so that it adequately resists the spread of fire between those buildings. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph a house in a terrace and a semi-detached house are each to be treated as a separate building.

(3)   Where reasonably necessary to inhibit the spread of fire within the building, measures shall be taken, to an extent appropriate to the size and intended use of the building, comprising either or both of the following—

(a)   sub-division of the building with fire-resisting construction;

(b)   installation of suitable automatic fire suppression systems.

 (4)   The building shall be designed and constructed so that the unseen spread of fire and smoke within concealed spaces in its structure and fabric is inhibited.

Intention

In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B3 is met by achieving all of the following.

a.  For defined periods, loadbearing elements of structure withstand the effects of fire without loss of stability.

b.  Compartmentation of buildings by fire resisting construction elements.

c.  Automatic fire suppression is provided where it is necessary.

d.  Protection of openings in fire-separating elements to maintain continuity of the fire separation.

e. Inhibition of the unseen spread of fire and smoke in cavities, in order to reduce the risk of structural failure and spread of fire and smoke, where they pose a threat to the safety of people in and around the building.

The extent to which any of these measures are necessary is dependent on the use of the building and, in some cases, its size, and on the location of the elements of construction. Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition 49

Loadbearing elements of structure

Fire resistance standard

5.1  Elements of structure such as structural frames, beams, columns, loadbearing walls (internal and external), floor structures and gallery structures should have, as a minimum, the fire resistance given in Appendix B, Table B3. 5.2 If one element of structure supports or stabilises another, as a minimum the supporting element should have the same fire resistance as the other element. 5.3  The following are excluded from the definition of ‘element of structure’.

a.  A structure that supports only a roof, unless either of the following applies.

i. The roof performs the function of a floor, such as a roof terrace, or as a means of escape.

ii.  The structure is essential for the stability of an external wall that needs to be fire resisting (e.g. to achieve compartmentation or for the purposes of preventing fire spread between buildings).

b.  The lowest floor of the building.

c.  External walls, such as curtain walls or other forms of cladding, which transmit only self weight and wind loads and do not transmit floor load.

NOTE: In some cases, structural members within a roof may be essential for the structural stability system of the building. In these cases, the structural members in the roof do not just support a roof and must demonstrate the relevant fire resistance for the building as required by paragraph 5.2 above.

Floors in loft conversions

5.4  Where adding an additional storey to a two storey single family dwellinghouse, new floors should have a minimum REI 30 fire resistance. Any floor forming part of the enclosure to the circulation space between the loft conversion and the final exit should achieve a minimum rating of REI 30.

The existing first-storey construction should have a minimum rating of R 30. The fire performance may be reduced for integrity and insulation, when both of the following conditions are met.

a.  Only one storey is added, containing a maximum of two habitable rooms.

b.  The new storey has a maximum total area of 50m2.

5.16  Cavities in the construction of a building provide a ready route for the spread of smoke and flame, which can present a greater danger as any spread is concealed. For the purpose of this document, a cavity is considered to be any concealed space. Provision of cavity barriers

5.17  To reduce the potential for fire spread, cavity barriers should be provided for both of the following.

a.  To divide cavities.

b.  To close the edges of cavities.

Cavity barriers should not be confused with fire-stopping details (Section 9).

5.18  Cavity barriers should be provided at all of the following locations.

a.  At the edges of cavities, including around openings (such as windows, doors and exit/entry points for services).

b.  At the junction between an external cavity wall and every compartment floor and compartment wall.

c.  At the junction between an internal cavity wall and every compartment floor, compartment wall or other wall or door assembly forming a fire resisting barrier. This does not apply where a wall meets the conditions of Diagram 5.3.

5.19  It is not appropriate to complete a line of compartment walls by fitting cavity barriers above them. The compartment wall should be extended to the underside of the floor or roof above.

5.20 Cavity barriers, tested from each side separately, should provide a minimum of both of the following:

a.  30 minutes’ integrity (E 30)

b.  15 minutes’ insulation (I 15).

They may be formed by a construction provided for another purpose if it achieves the same performance.

5.21  Cavity barriers in a stud wall or partition, or provided around openings, may be formed of any of the following. a.  Steel, a minimum of 0.5mm thick. b.  Timber, a minimum of 38mm thick.

c.  Polythene-sleeved mineral wool, or mineral wool slab, under compression when installed in the cavity.

d.  Calcium silicate, cement-based or gypsum-based boards, a minimum of 12mm thick.

These do not necessarily achieve the performance specified in paragraph 5.20.

NOTE: Cavity barriers provided around openings may be formed by the window or door frame, if the frame is constructed of steel or timber of the minimum thickness in (a) or (b), as appropriate. 5.22  Cavity barriers should be tightly fitted to a rigid construction and mechanically fixed in position. If this is not possible (e.g. where a cavity barrier joins to slates, tiles, corrugated sheeting or similar materials) the junction should be fire-stopped.

5.23  Cavity barriers should be fixed so their performance is unlikely to be made ineffective by any of the following.

a.  Movement of the building due to subsidence, shrinkage or temperature change, and movement of the external envelope due to wind.

b.  During a fire, collapse of services penetrating the cavity barriers, either by the failure of the supporting system or through degradation of the service itself (e.g. by melting or burning).

c.  During a fire, failure of the cavity barrier fixings. (In roof spaces, where cavity barriers are fixed to roof members, there is no expectation of fire resistance from roof members provided for the purpose of support.)

d.  During a fire, failure of any material or construction to which cavity barriers abut. (For example, a suspended ceiling that continues over a fire resisting wall or partition collapses, and the cavity barrier fails prematurely because the ceiling was not designed to provide a minimum fire resistance of EI 30.)

Openings in cavity barriers

5.24 Openings should be limited to the following. a.  Fire doorsets with a minimum E 30 rating, fitted in accordance with Appendix C.

b.  The passage of pipes that follow the provisions in Section 9.

c.  The passage of cables or conduits containing one or more cables.

d.  Openings fitted with a suitably mounted and appropriate fire damper.

Fire resistance standard

6.1  Elements of structure such as structural frames, beams, columns, loadbearing walls (internal and external), floor structures and gallery structures should have, as a minimum, the fire resistance given in Appendix B, Table B3. NOTE: If one element of structure supports or stabilises another, as a minimum the supporting element should have the same fire resistance as the other element. 6.2  The following are excluded from the definition of ‘element of structure’.

a.  A structure that supports only a roof, unless either of the following applies.

i. The roof performs the function of a floor, such as for parking vehicles, or as a means of escape.

ii.  The structure is essential for the stability of an external wall that needs to be fire resisting (e.g. to achieve compartmentation or for the purposes of preventing fire spread between buildings).

b.  The lowest floor of the building.

c.  A platform floor.

d.  External walls, such as curtain walls or other forms of cladding, which transmit only self weight and wind loads and do not transmit floor load.

NOTE: In some cases, structural members within a roof may be essential for the structural stability system of the building. In these cases, the structural members in the roof do not just support a roof and must demonstrate the relevant fire resistance for the building as required by the note to paragraph 6.1 above.

Additional guidance

6.3 If a loadbearing wall is any of the following, guidance in other sections may also apply.

a.  A compartment wall (including a wall common to two buildings): Section 7.

b.  Enclosing a place of special fire hazard: Section 7.

c.  Protecting a means of escape: Sections 2 and 3.

d.  An external wall: Sections 10 and 11.

6.5  Where an existing dwellinghouse or other building is converted into flats, a review of the existing construction should be carried out. Retained timber floors may make it difficult to meet the relevant provisions for fire resistance.

6.6  In a converted building with a maximum of three storeys, a minimum REI 30 fire resistance could be accepted for elements of structure if the means of escape conform to the provisions of Section 3. 6.7 In a converted building with four or more storeys, the full standard of fire resistance given in Appendix B is necessary. 58  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B3ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONSection 7: Compartmentation/sprinklers – flats

Provision of compartmentation

7.1  All of the following should be provided as compartment walls and compartment floors and should have, as a minimum, the fire resistance given in Appendix B, Table B3. a.  Any floor (unless it is within a flat, i.e. between one storey and another within one individual dwelling).

b.  Any wall separating a flat from another part of the building.

c.  Any wall enclosing a refuse storage chamber.

d.  Any wall common to two or more buildings.

Places of special fire hazard

7.2  Fire resisting construction enclosing these places should achieve minimum REI 30. These walls and floors are not compartment walls and compartment floors. 7.3  Parts of a building occupied mainly for different purposes should be separated from one another by compartment walls and/or compartment floors. Compartmentation is not needed if one of the different purposes is ancillary to the other. See paragraphs 0.18 and 0.19.

Sprinklers 7.4  Blocks of flats with a top storey more than 11m above ground level (see Diagram D6) should be fitted with a sprinkler system throughout the building in accordance with Appendix E.

NOTE: Sprinklers should be provided within the individual flats, they do not need to be provided in the common areas such as stairs, corridors or landings when these areas are fire sterile.

Construction of compartment walls and compartment floors

General provisions

7.5  All compartment walls and compartment floors should achieve both of the following.

a.  Form a complete barrier to fire between the compartments they separate.

b.  Have the appropriate fire resistance, as given in Appendix B, Tables B3 and B4.

7.6  Timber beams, joists, purlins and rafters may be built into or carried through a masonry or concrete compartment wall if the openings for them are both of the following.

a.  As small as practicable.

b.  Fire-stopped. If trussed rafters bridge the wall, failure of the truss due to a fire in one compartment should not cause failure of the truss in another compartment.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition 59

B3ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION7.7  Where services could provide a source of ignition, the risk of fire developing and spreading into adjacent compartments should be controlled.

Compartment walls between buildings

7.8  Adjoining buildings should only be separated by walls, not floors. Compartment walls common to two or more buildings should comply with both of the following.

a.  Run the full height of the building in a continuous vertical plane.

b.  Be continued through any roof space to the underside of the roof (see Diagram 5.2).

Separated parts of buildings

7.9  Compartment walls forming a separated part of a building should run the full height of the building in a continuous vertical plane. Separated parts can be assessed independently to determine the appropriate standard of fire resistance in each. The two separated parts can have different standards of fire resistance.

Other compartment walls

7.10  Compartment walls not described in paragraphs 7.8 and 7.9 should run the full height of the storey in which they are situated.

7.11  Compartment walls in a top storey beneath a roof should be continued through the roof space. Junction of compartment wall or compartment floor with other walls

7.12  At the junction with another compartment wall or an external wall, the fire resistance of the compartmentation should be maintained. Fire-stopping that meets the provisions in paragraphs 9.24 to 9.29 should be provided.

7.13  At the junction of a compartment floor and an external wall with no fire resistance, the external wall should be restrained at floor level. The restraint should reduce movement of the wall away from the floor if exposed to fire.

7.14  Compartment walls should be able to accommodate deflection of the floor, when exposed to fire, by either of the following means. a.  Between the wall and floor, provide a head detail that is capable of maintaining its integrity while deforming. b.  Design the wall so it maintains its integrity by resisting the additional vertical load from the floor above. Where compartment walls are located within the middle half of a floor between vertical supports, the deflection may be assumed to be 40mm unless a smaller value can be justified by assessment. Outside this area, the limit can be reduced linearly to zero at the supports. For steel beams that do not have the required fire resistance, reference should be made to SCI Publication P288.

Junction of compartment wall with roof

7.15  The requirements are the same as for dwellinghouses, detailed in paragraphs 5.11 and 5.12. 7.16  Materials achieving class B-s3, d2 or worse used as a substrate to the roof covering and any timber tiling battens, fully bedded in mortar or other suitable material for the width of the wall (Diagram 5.2b), may extend over the compartment wall in buildings that are both of the following.

Section 9: Protection of openings and fire‑stopping Introduction

9.1  Every joint, imperfect fit and opening for services through a fire-separating element should be sealed with fire-stopping to ensure that the fire resistance of the element is not impaired. Fire-

stopping delays the spread of fire and, generally, the spread of smoke as well. Openings for pipes

9.2  Pipes passing through a fire-separating element, unless in a protected shaft, should meet one of the alternatives A, B or C below.

Alternative A: Proprietary seals (any pipe diameter)

9.3  Provide a proprietary, tested sealing system that will maintain the fire resistance of the wall, floor or cavity barrier.

Alternative B: Pipes with a restricted diameter

9.4  Where a proprietary sealing system is not used, fire-stop around the pipe, keeping the opening for the pipe as small as possible. The nominal internal diameter of the pipe should not exceed the relevant dimension given in Table 9.1. The diameter given in Table 9.1 for pipes of specification (b) used in situation 2 or 3 assumes that the pipes are part of an above-ground drainage system and are enclosed as shown in Diagram 9.1. If they are not, the smaller diameter given for situation 5 should be used.

Alternative C: Sleeving

Mechanical ventilation and air‑conditioning systems

General provisions

9.6  Ductwork should not help to transfer fire and smoke through the building. Terminals of exhaust points should be sited away from final exits, cladding or roofing materials achieving class B-s3, d2 or worse and openings into the building.

9.7  Ventilation ducts supplying or extracting air directly to or from a protected stairway should not also serve other areas. A separate ventilation system should be provided for each protected stairway.

9.8  A fire and smoke damper should be provided where ductwork enters or leaves each section of the protected escape route it serves. It should be operated by a smoke detector or suitable fire detection system. Fire and smoke dampers should close when smoke is detected. Alternatively, the methods set out in paragraphs 9.16 and 9.17 and Diagrams 9.3 and 9.4 may be followed.

9.9 In a system that recirculates air, smoke detectors should be fitted in the extract ductwork before both of the following.

a.  The point where recirculated air is separated from air to be discharged to the outside.

b.  Any filters or other air cleaning equipment. When smoke is detected, detectors should do one of the following.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition 71

B3Table 9.1  Maximum nominal internal diameter of pipes passing through a fire-separating elementONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONi. ii. Cause the system to immediately shut down.

Switch the ventilation system from recirculating mode to extraction to divert smoke to outside the building.

9.10  In mixed use buildings, non-domestic kitchens, car parks and plant rooms should have separate and independent extraction systems. Extracted air should not be recirculated.

9.11  Under fire conditions, ventilation and air-conditioning systems should be compatible with smoke control systems and need to be considered in their respective design.

Ventilation ducts and flues passing through fire‑separating elements

General provisions

9.12  If air handling ducts pass through fire-separating elements, the fire performance of the elements should be maintained using one or more of the following four methods. In most ductwork systems, a combination of the four methods is best. a.  Method 1 – thermally activated fire dampers.

b.  Method 2 – fire resisting enclosures.

c.  Method 3 – protection using fire resisting ductwork.

d.  Method 4 – automatically activated fire and smoke dampers triggered by smoke detectors.

9.13  Further information on fire resisting ductwork is given in the ASFP Blue Book.

Flats and dwellings

9.14  Where ducts pass between fire-separating elements to serve multiple flats or dwellings, fire dampers or fire and smoke dampers should be actuated by both of the following.

a.  Smoke detector-controlled automatic release mechanisms.

b.  Thermally actuated devices.

Kitchen extract 9.15  Methods 1 and 4 should not be used for extract ductwork serving kitchens. The likely build-up of grease within the duct can adversely affect dampers.

Ducts passing through protected escape routes

9.16  Method 1 should not be used for extract ductwork passing through the enclosures of protected escape routes (Diagrams 9.3 and 9.4), as large volumes of smoke can pass thermal devices without triggering them.

9.17  An ES classified fire and smoke damper which is activated by a suitable fire detection system (method 4) may also be used for protected escape routes. 72  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B4ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Intention

Resisting fire spread over external walls

The external envelope of a building should not contribute to undue fire spread from one part of a building to another part. This intention can be met by constructing external walls so that both of the following are satisfied.

a.  The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building and spread of fire over the outside surface is restricted.

b.  The materials used to construct external walls, and attachments to them, and how they are assembled do not contribute to the rate of fire spread up the outside of the building.

The extent to which this is necessary depends on the height and use of the building. Resisting fire spread from one building to another

The external envelope of a building should not provide a medium for undue fire spread to adjacent buildings or be readily ignited by fires in adjacent buildings. This intention can be met by constructing external walls so that all of the following are satisfied.

a.  The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building is restricted.

b.  The amount of thermal radiation that falls on a neighbouring building from window openings and other unprotected areas in the building on fire is not enough to start a fire in the other building.

c.  Flame spread over the roof and/or fire penetration from external sources through the roof is restricted.

The extent to which this is necessary depends on the use of the building and its position in relation to adjacent buildings and therefore the site boundary.

B4ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONSection 10: Resisting fire spread over external walls

Introduction

10.1  The external wall of a building should not provide a medium for fire spread if that is likely to be a risk to health and safety. Combustible materials and cavities in external walls and attachments to them can present such a risk, particularly in tall buildings. The guidance in this section is designed to reduce the risk of fire spread as well as the risk of ignition from flames coming from adjacent buildings.

Fire resistance

10.2  This section provides guidance on resisting fire spread over external walls; however, it does not deal with fire resistance of external walls. An external wall may need fire resistance to meet the provisions of Section 3 (Means of escape – flats), Section 6 (Loadbearing elements of structure – flats), Section 11 (Resisting fire spread from one building to another) or Section 15 (Access to buildings for firefighting personnel – flats).

Combustibility of external walls

10.3  The external walls of buildings other than those described in regulation 7(4) of the Building Regulations should achieve either of the following. a.  Follow the provisions given in paragraphs 10.5 to 10.9, which provide guidance on all of the following.

i. External surfaces.

ii.  Materials and products.

iii.  Cavities and cavity barriers. b.  Meet the performance criteria given in BRE report BR 135 for external walls using full-scale test data from BS 8414-1 or BS 8414-2.

10.4 In relation to buildings of any height or use, consideration should be given to the choice of materials (including their extent and arrangement) used for the external wall, or attachments to the wall (e.g. balconies, etc.), to reduce the risk of fire spread over the wall.

b. Achieve both of the following conditions. i.  Have an imperforate soffit which extends to the full area of the balcony, achieves a minimum REI 30 rating and is constructed of materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or better. Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition 81

B4ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONii.  Materials achieving class B-s1, d0 or worse extending beyond the boundary of a single compartment should include a band of material rated class A2-s1, d0 or better, a minimum of 300mm in width centred on that boundary line. Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph.

Metal composite materials 10.11  Regulation 7(1A) prohibits the use of relevant metal composite materials in the external walls, and specified attachments, of all buildings of any height. 10.12 Relevant metal composite materials are defined (in regulation 2(6)(c)) as any panel or sheet, having a thickness of no more than 10mm which is composed of a number of layers two or more of which are made of metal, alloy or metal compound and one or more of which is a substantial layer made of a material having a gross calorific value of more than 35MJ/kg when tested in accordance with BS EN ISO 1716. A substantial layer is defined as a layer which is at least 1mm thick or has a mass per unit area of at least 1kg/m². Regulation 7(2) and requirement B4

Materials 10.13 Regulation 7(1)(a) requires that materials used in building work are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used. Regulation 7(2) sets requirements in respect of external walls and specified attachments in relevant buildings.

NOTE: Further guidance on regulation 7(1) can be found in HM Government’s Manual to the Building Regulations.

10.14 Regulation 7(2) applies to any building with a storey at least 18m above ground level (as measured in accordance with Diagram D6 in Appendix D) and which contains one or more dwellings; an institution; or a room for residential purposes. It requires that all materials which become part  of an external wall or specified attachment achieve class A2-s1, d0 or class A1 in accordance with  BS EN 13501-1, other than those exempted by regulation 7(3).

NOTE: The above includes student accommodation, care homes, sheltered housing, hospitals, dormitories in boarding schools, hotels, hostels and boarding houses. See regulation 7(4) for the definition of relevant buildings.

NOTE: Transposition to a national class (Table B1) does not apply to the classification in this paragraph. 10.15 External walls and specified attachments are defined in regulation 2(6) and these definitions include any parts of the external wall as well as balconies, solar panels and solar shading.

10.16 Regulation 7(3) provides an exemption for certain components found in external walls and specified attachments.

82  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B4ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONMaterial change of use

10.17 Regulations 5(k) and 6(3) provide that, where the use of a building is changed such that the building becomes a building described in regulation 7(4), the construction of the external walls, and specified attachments, must be investigated and, where necessary, work must be carried out to ensure they only contain materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or class A1, other than those exempted by regulation 7(3).

Solar shading devices 10.18 Regulation 7(2) requires that the curtain and or slats of solar shading devices in a relevant building (as defined in regulation 7(4)) achieve class A1 or A2-s1, d0. The curtain of solar shading devices cannot be classified as a membrane in accordance with regulation 7(3). 10.19 Solar shading devices installed up to 4.5m above ground level are not required to meet the requirements of regulation 7(2). Additional considerations

10.20 The provisions of regulation 7 apply in addition to requirement B4. Therefore, for buildings described in regulation 7(4), the potential impact of any products incorporated into or onto the external walls and specified attachments should be carefully considered with regard to their number, size, orientation and position. 10.21 Particular attention is drawn to the following points.

a.  Membranes used as part of the external wall construction above ground level should achieve a minimum of class B-s3, d0. Roofing membranes do not need to achieve a minimum of class A2-

s1, d0 when used as part of a roof connecting to an external wall. b. Internal linings should comply with the guidance provided in Section 4. c.  Any part of a roof should achieve the minimum performance as detailed in Section 12.

d.  As per regulation 7(3), window frames and glass (including laminated glass) are exempted from regulation 7(2). Window spandrel panels and infill panels must comply with regulation 7(2).

e. Thermal breaks are small elements used as part of the external wall construction to restrict thermal bridging. There is no minimum performance for these materials. However, they should not span two compartments and should be limited in size to the minimum required to restrict the thermal bridging (the principal insulation layer is not to be regarded as a thermal break).

f. Regulation 7(2) only applies to specified attachments. Shop front signs and similar attachments are not covered by the requirements of regulation 7(2), although attention is drawn to paragraph 10.21g.

g.  While regulation 7(2) applies to materials which become part of an external wall or specified attachment, consideration should be given to other attachments to the wall which could impact on the risk of fire spread over the wall.

h.  Any material achieving class A1fl or A2fl-s1 in accordance with BS EN 13501-1 is exempted when it meets both of the following conditions. i. ii. It forms the top horizontal floor layer of a balcony.

It is provided with an imperforate substrate under it which extends to the full size of the class A1fl or A2fl-s1 material. Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition 83

Introduction

11.1  The following assumptions enable a reasonable standard of resistance to the spread of fire to  be specified.

a.  The size of a fire depends on the compartmentation within the building. A fire may involve a complete compartment, but will not spread to other compartments.

b.  The intensity of a fire is related to the building use, but can be moderated by a sprinkler system.

c.  Fires in ‘residential’ and ‘assembly and recreation’ buildings (purpose groups 1, 2 and 5) represent a greater risk to life.

d.  A building on the far side of the relevant boundary meets both of the following conditions.

i.  Has a similar elevation to the one in question.

ii. Is the same distance as the one in question from the common boundary.

e.  The radiated heat passing through any part of the fire resisting external wall may be discounted.

11.2  Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over the provisions within this section. 11.3 If a reduced separation distance between buildings, or increased amount of unprotected area, is required, smaller compartments should be considered. Boundaries

11.4  The fire resistance of a wall depends on its distance from the relevant boundary (see Diagram 11.1). Separation distances are measured to boundaries to ensure that the location and design of buildings on adjoining sites have no influence on the building under consideration.

11.5  The boundary that a wall faces is the relevant boundary (Diagram 11.2). It may be one of  the following. a. The site boundary. b. The centre line of a space where further development is unlikely, such as a road, railway, canal  or river. c. An assumed notional boundary between two buildings on the same site (Diagram 11.3) where either of the following conditions is met. i.  One or both of the buildings are in the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose group 1, 2 or 5). ii.  The buildings will be operated/managed by different organisations. 84  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

11.6  Parts of an external wall with less fire resistance than the appropriate amount given in Appendix B, Table B4, are called unprotected areas.

11.7  Where a fire resisting external wall has an external surface material that is worse than class B-s3, d2 and is more than 1mm thick, that part of the wall should be classified as an unprotected area equating to half its area (Diagram 11.4).

External walls on, and within 1000mm of, the relevant boundary

11.8  Unprotected areas should meet the conditions in Diagram 11.5, and the rest of the wall should be fire resisting from both sides.

External surface materials facing the boundary should be class B-s3, d2 or better.

External walls 1000mm or more from the relevant boundary

11.9  Unprotected areas should not exceed the result given by one of the methods in paragraph 11.16, and the rest of the wall (if any) should be fire resisting but only from the inside of the building. External walls of protected stairways

11.10  Exclude external walls of stairways in a protected shaft when assessing unprotected areas (see Diagram 11.5).

Roofs

11.14  Roofs with a pitch of more than 70 degrees to the horizontal should be assessed in accordance with this section. Vertical parts of a pitched roof, such as dormer windows, should be included only if the slope of the roof exceeds 70 degrees. It is a matter of judgement whether a continuous run of dormer windows that occupies most of a steeply pitched roof should be treated as a wall rather than a roof.

Portal frames

11.15  Portal frames are often used in single storey industrial and commercial buildings where there may be no need for fire resistance of the structure (requirement B3). However, where a portal framed building is near a relevant boundary, the external wall near the boundary may need fire resistance to restrict the spread of fire between buildings. It is generally accepted that a portal frame acts as a single structural element because of the moment-resisting connections used, especially at the column/rafter joints. Thus, in cases where the external wall of the building cannot be wholly unprotected, the rafter members of the frame, as well as the column members, may need to be fire protected. The design method for this is set out in SCI Publication P313.

NOTE: The recommendations in the SCI publication for designing the foundation to resist overturning do not need to be followed if the building is fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.

NOTE: Normally, portal frames of reinforced concrete can support external walls requiring a similar degree of fire resistance without specific provision at the base to resist overturning.

NOTE: Existing buildings may have been designed to comply with all of the following guidance, which is also acceptable.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 1, 2019 edition 89

B4ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONa.  The column members are fixed rigidly to a base of sufficient size and depth to resist overturning.

b.  There is brick, block or concrete protection to the columns up to a protected ring beam providing lateral support.

c.  There is some form of roof venting to give early heat release. (The roof venting could be, for example, PVC rooflights covering some 10% of the floor area and evenly spaced over the floor area.)

Methods for calculating acceptable unprotected area

11.16  Two simple methods are given for calculating the acceptable amount of unprotected area in an external wall that is a minimum of 1000mm from any point on the relevant boundary. More precise methods are described in BRE report BR 187 and may be used instead. When using BR 187 the following radiation intensity at each unprotected area should be assumed.

a.  84kW/m2 if the purpose group of the building is ‘residential’ (purpose groups 1 or 2), ‘office’ (purpose group 3) or ‘assembly and recreation’ (purpose group 5) or if the building is an open-

sided multi-storey car park (purpose group 7(b)).

b.  168kW/m2 if the purpose group of the building is ‘shop and commercial’ (purpose group 4), ‘industrial’ (purpose group 6) or ‘storage and other non-residential’ (purpose group 7(a)).

Method 1

11.17  This method applies to small buildings intended to be used for blocks of flats or dwellinghouses.

11.18  The building should not exceed three storeys in height (excluding basements) or 24m in length. Each side of the building should meet the limits stated in Diagram 11.7. Any small unprotected areas falling within the limits shown in Diagram 11.5 can be ignored.

12.1 12.2  Provisions for the fire properties of roofs are given in other parts of this document.

‘Roof covering’ describes one or more layers of material, but not the roof structure as a whole. a.  Requirement B1 – for roofs that are part of a means of escape.

b.  Requirement B2 – for the internal surfaces of rooflights as part of internal linings.

c.  Requirement B3 – for roofs that are used as a floor and for roofs passing over a compartment wall.

d.  Section 11 – the circumstances in which a roof is subject to the provisions for space separation.

Separation distances

12.3  Separation distance is the minimum distance from the roof, or part of the roof, to the relevant boundary (paragraph 11.4). Table 12.1 sets out separation distances by the type of roof covering and the size and use of the building. In addition, roof covering products (and/or materials) defined in Commission Decision 2000/553/

EC of 6 September 2000, implementing Council Directive 89/106/EEC, can be considered to fulfil all of the requirements for the performance characteristic ‘external fire performance’ without the need for testing, provided that any national provisions on the design and execution of works are fulfilled, and can be used without restriction.

12.4  The performance of rooflights is specified in a similar way to the performance of roof coverings. Plastic rooflights may also be used.

Plastic rooflights

12.5  Table 12.2 and Diagram 12.1 set the limitations for using plastic rooflights whose lower surface has a minimum class D-s3, d2 rating.

12.6  Table 12.3 sets the limitations for using thermoplastic materials with a TP(a) rigid or TP(b) (see also Diagram 12.1) classification. The method of classifying thermoplastic materials is given in Appendix B.

12.7  Other than for the purposes of Diagram 5.2, polycarbonate or uPVC rooflights achieving a minimum  rating of class C-s3, d2 can be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification.

Access and facilities for the fire service

B5. (1)   The building shall be designed and constructed so as to provide reasonable facilities to assist fire fighters in the protection of life.

(2)   Reasonable provision shall be made within the site of the building to enable fire appliances to gain access to the building.

Limits on application

Intention

Provisions covering access and facilities for the fire service are to safeguard the health and safety of people in and around the building. Their extent depends on the size and use of the building. Most firefighting is carried out within the building. In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B5 is met by achieving all of the following.

a.  External access enabling fire appliances to be used near the building.

b.  Access into and within the building for firefighting personnel to both:

i. ii. search for and rescue people

fight fire.

c.  Provision for internal fire facilities for firefighters to complete their tasks.

d.  Ventilation of heat and smoke from a fire in a basement.

e.  A facility to store building information for firefighters to complete their tasks.

If an alternative approach is taken to providing the means of escape, outside the scope of this approved document, additional provisions for firefighting access may be required. Where deviating from the general guidance, it is advisable to seek advice from the fire and rescue service as early as possible (even if there is no statutory duty to consult).

Section 16: Venting of heat and smoke from basements – flats

Provision of smoke outlets

16.1  Heat and smoke from basement fires vented via stairs can inhibit access for firefighting personnel. This may be reduced by providing smoke outlets, or smoke vents, which allow heat and smoke to escape from the basement levels to the open air. They can also be used by the fire and rescue service to let cooler air into the basements (Diagram 16.1). 16.2  Each basement space should have one or more smoke outlets.

Where this is not practicable (for example, the plan area is deep and the amount of external wall is restricted by adjoining buildings), the perimeter basement spaces may be vented, with other spaces vented indirectly by opening connecting doors. This does not apply for places of special fire hazard (see paragraph 16.7). If a basement is compartmented, each compartment should have one or more smoke outlets, rather than indirect venting.

A basement storey or compartment containing rooms with doors or windows does not need smoke outlets.

16.3  Smoke outlets connecting directly to the open air should be provided from every basement storey, except for any basement storey that has both of the following.

a.  A maximum floor area of 200m2.

b.  A floor a maximum of 3m below the adjacent ground level.

16.4  Strong rooms do not need to be provided with smoke outlets.

Natural smoke outlets

16.5  Smoke outlets should be both of the following.

a.  Sited at high level in either the ceiling or wall of the space they serve.

b.  Evenly distributed around the perimeter, to discharge to the open air.

16.6  The combined clear cross-sectional area of all smoke outlets should be a minimum of 1/40 of the area of the floor of the storey they serve.

16.7  Separate outlets should be provided from places of special fire hazard.

16.8  If the smoke outlet terminates at a point that is not readily accessible, it should be kept unobstructed and covered only with a class A1 grille or louvre.

16.9  If the smoke outlet terminates in a readily accessible position, it may be covered by a panel, stallboard or pavement light that can be broken out or opened. The position of covered smoke outlets should be suitably indicated.

16.10 Outlets should not be placed where they prevent the use of escape routes from the building.

Mechanical smoke extract

16.11  If basement storeys are fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E, a mechanical smoke extraction system may be provided as an alternative to natural venting. Sprinklers do not need to be installed on the other storeys unless needed for other reasons.

Car parks are not normally expected to be fitted with sprinklers (see Section 11 of Approved Document B Volume 2).

16.12 The air extraction system should comply with all of the following.

a. It should give at least 10 air changes per hour.

b. It should be capable of handling gas temperatures of 300°C for not less than one hour.

c. It should do either of the following.

i. Be activated automatically if the sprinkler system activates.

ii.  Be activated by an automatic fire detection system that conforms to BS 5839-1 (minimum L3 standard). Further information on equipment for removing hot smoke is given in BS EN 12101-3.
