Section 0: Approved Document M Volume 1: Access to and use of dwellings Summary 0.1  This approved document gives guidance about how to comply with requirements M4(1), M4(2) and M4(3) of the Building Regulations. It contains the following sections:

Section 1: Category 1 – Visitable dwellings

Section 2: Category 2 – Accessible and adaptable dwellings

Section 3: Category 3 – Wheelchair user dwellings

Application 0.2  The recommendations of this volume of this approved document apply to newly erected dwellings,  and dwellings undergoing material alteration, only. They do not apply to the extension of a dwelling. Optional requirements

0.3  Requirements M4(2) and M4(3) are ‘optional requirements’ as defined in the Building Regulations. An optional requirement only applies where a condition that one or more dwellings should meet the relevant optional requirement is imposed on new development as part of the process of granting planning permission. Where no condition is imposed, dwellings only need to meet requirements M4(1). Compliance should be assessed against only one of requirements M4(1), M4(2) or M4(3) for any given dwelling.

0.4  Where any part of an approach route, including vertical circulation in the common parts of a block of flats, is shared between dwellings of different categories, Section A of the optional requirement for the highest numbered category of dwelling served will apply to that part of the approach route. 0.5  Where a local planning authority sets a planning condition for Category 3 (wheelchair user) housing it can specify which dwellings should be wheelchair accessible by including in the planning permission a condition stating that optional requirement M4(3)(2)(b) applies. Where no such condition is applied, optional requirement M4(3)(2)(a) will apply by default requiring that dwellings should be wheelchair adaptable. 0.6  The person carrying out building work must inform the building control body where any optional requirements apply. Interaction with other legislation The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations

0.7 If people, such as cleaners and caretakers, are employed to work in the common parts of flats and similar buildings the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations will apply.

0.8  The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations contain some requirements that affect building design. The main requirements are covered by the Building Regulations. For further information see www.hse.gov.uk. Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document M Volume 1, 2015 edition 1

ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONThe Equality Act 2010 and Equality Act 2010 (Disability) Regulations

0.9  Those who dispose of, let or manage premises are subject to the provisions in Part 4 of the Equality Act 2010. The Act protects people who meet the Act’s definition of a disabled person from disability discrimination, harassment and victimisation. The provisions in Part 4 of the Act do not apply to the erection of new dwellings.   Mixed use development

0.10  Common areas in mixed use development containing both domestic and non domestic functions should meet the requirements for non-domestic buildings in Approved Document M: Volume 2.

Material alterations

0.11  Where a dwelling is subject to a material alteration, the building should be no less compliant with requirement M4(1) than it was prior to the building work taking place.

Historic buildings 0.12  Historic buildings include listed buildings, buildings in conservation areas, buildings of architectural merit referred to as a material consideration in a Local Plan, buildings of architectural and historic merit within national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, world heritage sites and vernacular buildings of traditional form and construction.

0.13  Requirements for accessibility should be balanced against preserving historic buildings or environments. In achieving an appropriate balance it would be appropriate to take into account the advice of the local authority’s conservation and access officers, English Heritage and the views of local access groups.

Interaction with Parts C and K of the Building Regulations

0.14  Requirements M4(1), M4(2) and M4(3) of Part M set out requirements for stepped and ramped approaches forming part of accessible approach routes in and around dwellings. Part K sets out requirements for stepped or ramped approaches which form part of a building other than where the requirements of Part M are applicable. Where both Part M and Part K apply, requirement M4(1), M4(2) or M4(3) as appropriate of Part M takes precedence.

0.15  In meeting the provisions of Part M by providing a level or ramped approach and level threshold, care must be taken to ensure the moisture resistance and design of the dwelling as a whole also complies with requirements C2 and C4. 2 Approved Document M Volume 1, 2015 edition Building Regulations 2010

Section 1A: Approach to the dwelling

Application

1.1  The provisions of Section 1A apply to external and internal areas and elements that form part of the approach route to the dwelling and fall within the plot (or curtilage) of the individual dwelling, or the building containing the dwelling. 1.2  Where parking is not provided within the curtilage, the provisions apply to the approach route between the dwelling and the nearest point at which a visitor, including a disabled person, would expect to get in and out of a car. This point of access may be within or outside the plot of the dwelling, or the building containing the dwelling (such as a block of flats). These provisions do not apply beyond the curtilage of the development.

Approach routes

General 1.3  The approach route should be safe and convenient for everyone, including older and disabled people and some wheelchair users. It should adopt the shallowest gradient that can reasonably be achieved and be step-free where possible. 1.4  The approach route should be level, gently sloping, or, where necessary, ramped. On steeply sloping plots, a stepped approach can be used.

1.5  Normally these provisions will apply to the principal private entrance but where this is not possible, access to a suitable alternative entrance would be reasonable. 1.6  To enable most people to approach the dwelling, approach routes should comply with all of the following.

a.  The approach route is level, gently sloping, ramped or, where unavoidable, stepped.

b.  All external parts of the approach route have a suitable ground surface.

c.  The approach route is a minimum of 900mm wide with a maximum cross fall of 1 in 40.

Application

2.1  The provisions of Section 2A apply only where a planning condition requires compliance with optional requirement M4(2) for accessible and adaptable dwellings (see paragraphs 0.3 to 0.6). 2.2  The provisions of Section 2A apply to external and internal areas and elements that form part of the approach route to the individual dwelling and fall within the plot (or curtilage) of the dwelling or the building containing the dwelling. 2.3  The provisions also apply to the approach route between the dwelling and the point, or points, at which an occupant or visitor, including a disabled person, would expect to get in and out of a car. This point, or points, of access may be within or outside the plot of the dwelling or the building containing the dwelling (typically a block of flats). These provisions do not apply beyond the curtilage of the development.

2.4  Reasonable provision should be made to ensure that the approach route to any communal facilities that serve the dwelling meets these provisions. Communal facilities include storage areas, such as those used for depositing refuse and recycling, but not plant rooms or other service areas unless occupants need regular access, for example for meter reading.

2.5  For a house (or other dwelling that sits within its own plot) the approach route will often only involve a driveway, or a gate and a path, but for a dwelling within a larger building (typically a block of flats) the approach route will usually involve one, or more, communal gates, paths, entrances, doors, lobbies, corridors and access decks, as well as communal lifts and stairs. Approach routes

General 2.6  The approach route should be safe and convenient, adopt the shallowest gradient that can reasonably be achieved and be step-free, irrespective of the storey on which the dwelling is located. 2.7  Where it is not reasonable to achieve a step-free approach route to the principal private entrance, a step-free approach route should be provided to a suitable alternative private entrance instead. The provisions for approach routes (other than those relating specifically to step-free access) should still apply to both the route to the principal private entrance and the route to the alternative private entrance. 2.8  Where a communal ramped approach route is provided and has an overall rise of 300mm or more, an additional stepped route meeting the requirements of paragraph 2.11 should also be provided.

3.2  The provisions of Section 3A apply to specific external and internal areas and elements that form part of the approach route to the dwelling and fall within the plot (or curtilage) of the individual dwelling, or the building containing the dwelling. 3.3  The provisions of Section 3A also apply to the approach route between the dwelling and the point, or points, at which a wheelchair user, or other disabled occupant or visitor, would expect to get in and out of a car. This point, or points, of access may be within or outside the plot of the dwelling, or the building containing the dwelling. These provisions do not apply beyond the curtilage of the development.

3.4  Reasonable provision should also be made to ensure that the approach route to any communal facilities intended to serve the dwelling meets these provisions. Communal facilities include storage areas, such as those used for depositing refuse and recycling, but not plant rooms or other service areas unless occupants need regular access to equipment within these spaces, for example for meter reading.

3.5  For a house (or other dwelling that sits within its own plot) the approach route will often only involve a driveway, or a gate and a path. For a dwelling within a larger building (typically a block of flats) the approach route usually involves one, or more, communal gates, paths, entrances, doors, lobbies, corridors and access decks, as well as communal lifts and stairs. 3.6  All the provisions of Section 3A apply to wheelchair adaptable and wheelchair accessible dwellings. Approach routes

General provisions 3.7  The approach route should be safe and convenient for everyone, be at the shallowest gradient that can reasonably be achieved, and be step-free, irrespective of the storey on which the dwelling is located. Approach routes to dedicated storage for mobility scooters (where provided) should also be step-free. 3.8  A step-free approach route should be provided to all private entrances. Where a communal ramped approach route is provided and has an overall rise of 300mm or more, an additional stepped route meeting the requirements of paragraph 3.11 should also be provided.

Bathroom facilities 3.41  To make suitable and convenient provision for a wheelchair user to bathe or use a wheelchair accessible shower, with assistance where necessary, the dwelling should comply with all of the following.

a.  Dwellings with up to four bedspaces should have as a minimum a bathroom that contains a WC, a basin and an installed level access shower with the potential for a bath to be installed above it (unless a bath is provided in addition to the installed level access shower within this bathroom or elsewhere on the same storey). b.  The bathroom containing the installed level access shower should be located on the same storey as the principal double bedroom described in paragraph 3.35.

NOTE 1: In dwellings with five bedspaces or more, where the provisions of paragraphs 3.42 or 3.43 are satisfied by providing both a bathroom and a shower room, either room (but not both) may be an en-suite bathroom.

NOTE 2: Where there is a fully accessible shower room on the same storey as the principal bedroom, a separate room providing the bath need only comply with the requirements set out in paragraph 2.29 for a Category 2 bathroom. NOTE 3: In dwellings with up to four bedspaces it would be reasonable for a bath to be fitted above the installed level access shower at the point that the works are completed. 3.42 Where the dwelling is defined as wheelchair adaptable, it is assumed that most commonly a bath will be installed over a useable level access shower, though this is not a requirement. Wheelchair adaptable bathrooms should also comply with all of the following.

a.  The WC, basin, bath and shower (and their associated clear access zones) meet at least the provisions shown in Diagram 3.10. Examples of compliant designs are shown in Diagram 3.15.

b.  Drawings illustrate how the bathroom could be easily adapted in future to meet the provisions for a wheelchair accessible bathroom set out in paragraph 3.43 (but need only show either a bath or level access shower, not both).

3.43  Where the dwelling is defined as wheelchair accessible, the bathroom should also comply with all of the following.

a.  The WC, basin, bath (where provided) and shower (and their associated clear access zones), meet the provisions in Diagram 3.11. Examples of compliant designs are shown in Diagram 3.16.

b. c. In dwellings with up to four bedspaces, an installed level access shower is provided as the default but a bath can be accommodated as an alternative if required.

In dwellings with five bedspaces or more, both a useable bath and an installed level access shower are provided (either in one bathroom or in more than one bathroom on the same storey as the principal bedroom). Examples of bathrooms with shower and bath are provided in Diagram 3.17.

d.  The level access shower is positioned in a corner to enable a shower seat to be fitted on one wall, with shower controls fitted on the adjacent wall.

e.  The bathroom (or bathrooms) provides a minimum 1500mm clear turning circle.
