Section 1: Fire detection and alarm systems

General provisions

1.1  All buildings should have arrangements for detecting fire and raising the alarm. In most buildings, fires are detected by people, either by sight or smell, and therefore often nothing more is needed. 1.2 In some small buildings/premises, the means of raising the alarm may be simple (for example, a shouted warning). In assessing appropriate solutions, warnings need to be heard and understood throughout the premises.

Fire detection and alarm systems

1.3  Other than for some small buildings/premises, an electrically operated fire alarm system should be provided. In some situations, the alarm should be operated by a fire detection system. The detailed specification should be compatible with the fire strategy for the building.

NOTE: The term ‘fire alarm system’ describes the combination of components for giving an audible and/or other perceptible warning of fire.

NOTE: In this document, the term ‘fire detection system’ describes any type of automatic sensor network and associated control and indicating equipment. Sensors may be sensitive to smoke, heat, gaseous combustion products or radiation. Automatic sprinkler systems can also be used to operate a fire alarm system.

1.4 In ‘residential (institutional)’ and ‘residential (other)’ occupancies (purpose groups 2(a) and 2(b)), automatic fire detection and alarms should be provided.

1.5  Automatic fire detection and alarm systems should be provided in non-residential occupancies where a fire could break out in an unoccupied part of the premises (e.g. a storage area or a part of the building that is not visited on a regular basis) and prejudice the means of escape from occupied part(s) of the premises.

1.6  Automatic fire detection will also be necessary where fire protection systems, such as pressure differential systems or door releases, need to operate automatically. 1.7  Every building design should be assessed individually. General guidance on the category of fire detection system that may need to be provided within a building can be found in Table A1 of BS 5839-1. 1.8  Where an electrically operated fire detection and alarm system is provided, it should comply  with BS 5839-1.

1.9  BS 5839-1 specifies three categories of system.

a.  Category L – for the protection of life.

b.  Category M – manual fire detection and alarm systems.

c.  Category P – for property protection. Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 9

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONCategory L systems are divided into the following.

L1 – systems installed throughout the protected building.

L2 – systems installed only in defined parts of the protected building (a category L2 system will normally include the coverage required of a category L3 system).

L3 – systems designed to warn of fire at an early enough stage to enable all occupants, other than possibly those in the room where the fire started, to escape safely before the escape routes become impassable because of fire, smoke or toxic gases.

L4 – systems installed within those parts of the escape routes that comprise circulation areas and circulation spaces, such as corridors and stairs.

L5 – systems in which the protected area(s) and/or the location of detectors are designed to satisfy a specific fire safety objective (other than that of a category L1, L2, L3 or L4 system).

Type P systems are divided into the following.

P1 – systems installed throughout the protected building.

P2 – systems installed only in defined parts of the protected building.

1.10  Electrical alarm system call points should comply with either of the following.

a.  BS 5839-2. b.  BS EN 54-11 Type A (direct operation). Call points should be installed in accordance with BS 5839-1. Type B (indirect operation) call points of BS EN 54-11 should only be used with the approval of the building control body.

1.11  A voice alarm system complying with BS 5839-8, and giving a fire warning different from other signals in general use, may be considered if either of the following applies.

a.  People might not respond quickly to a fire warning.

b.  People are unfamiliar with the fire warning arrangements.

1.12 In premises where lots of members of the public are present, an initial general alarm may be undesirable. Any fire alarm system that first alerts staff should comply with BS 5839-1.

1.13  Where the escape strategy is based on simultaneous evacuation, actuation of the fire alarm system should give warning from all fire alarm sounders. Where phased evacuation is planned, a staged alarm system is appropriate. See paragraph 3.21.

1.14  BS 9999 provides guidance for fire detection and alarm systems in buildings containing atria. Warnings for people with impaired hearing

1.15  Clause 18 of BS 5839-1 gives detailed guidance on the design and selection of fire alarm warnings for people with impaired hearing. In buildings or part of a building where people may be in relative isolation, a visual and audible fire alarm may be the most appropriate solution. In buildings where the population is managed, a vibrating personal paging system may be more appropriate.

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONDesign and installation of systems

1.16  Fire detection and alarm systems must be properly designed, installed and maintained. A design, installation and commissioning certificate should be provided for fire detection and alarm systems. Third party certification schemes for fire protection products and related services are an effective means of providing assurances of quality, reliability and safety.

Interface between fire detection and alarm systems and other systems

1.17  Fire detection and alarm systems sometimes trigger other systems. The interface between systems must be reliable. Particular care should be taken if the interface is facilitated via another system. Where any part of BS 7273 applies to the triggering of other systems, the recommendations of that part of BS 7273 should be followed.

Student accommodation 1.18 In student residences that are designed and occupied as a block of flats, separate automatic detection should be provided in each self-contained flat where all of the following apply. a.  A group of up to six students shares the flat. b.  Each flat has its own entrance door. c.  The compartmentation principles for flats in Section 7 of Approved Document B Volume 1 have been followed. Where a total evacuation strategy is adopted, the alarm system should follow the guidance elsewhere in this section.

Section 2: Design for horizontal escape Introduction

2.1  Means of escape should be provided from any point on a storey to the storey exit, for all types of building. The general principle is that any person confronted by a fire within a building can turn away from it and escape safely.

2.2  For small shop, office, industrial, storage and other similar premises, the guidance on small premises (see section 4) may be followed instead of the provisions in this section, if they meet both of the following conditions.

a.  No storey has an area more than 280m2.

b.  There is a maximum of two storeys plus a basement storey.

Escape route design

Number of escape routes and exits

2.3  The number of escape routes and exits that should be provided depends on both of the following.

a.  The number of occupants in the room, tier or storey.

b.  The limits on travel distance to the nearest exit given in Table 2.1 (which apply only to the nearest exit; other exits may be further away).

In multi-storey buildings, if more than one stair is needed for vertical escape, every part of each storey should have access to more than one stair. An area may be in a dead end provided the alternative stair is accessible.

In mixed use buildings, separate means of escape should be provided from any storeys or parts  of storeys used for the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose groups 1,  2 and 5).

Single escape routes and exits

2.6  A single escape route is acceptable for either of the following.

a.  Parts of a floor from which a storey exit can be reached within the limit for travel distance in one direction shown in Table 2.1 (see also paragraph 2.8), provided the following apply.

i. ii. For places of assembly and bars, no one room in this situation has more than 60 people.

For ‘residential (institutional)’ buildings (purpose group 2(a)), no one room in this situation has more than 30 people. Occupant number calculations are described in Appendix D.

b.  A storey with no more than 60 people, where the limits on travel distance in one direction only are satisfied (see Table 2.1).

2.7 In many cases, the beginning of a route will not have an alternative escape route (for example, a single exit from a room into a corridor where escape is possible in two directions). This is acceptable if both of the following apply. a.  The travel distance to the nearest storey exit is within the limits for routes where escape is possible in more than one direction (Table 2.1).

b.  The travel distance for the ‘one direction only’ section of the route does not exceed the limit for travel distance where there is no alternative escape route (Table 2.1).

NOTES:

1.  If the internal layout of partitions, fittings, etc. is not known, direct distances, rather than travel distances, should be assessed. The direct distance should be assumed to be two-thirds of the actual travel distance.

2.  Maximum part of travel distance within the room. This limit applies within the bedroom and any associated dressing room, bathroom or sitting room, etc. The distance is measured to the door to the protected corridor that serves the room or suite. Sub-item (b) applies from that point along the bedroom corridor to a storey exit.

3.  In industrial and storage buildings, the appropriate travel distance depends on the level of fire hazard associated with the processes and materials being used.  Higher hazard includes manufacturing, processing or storage of significant amounts of hazardous goods or materials, including any of the following. •  Any compressed, liquefied or dissolved gas.

•  Any substance that becomes dangerous by interaction with either air or water.

•  Any liquid substance with a flash point below 65°C, including whisky or other alcoholic liquor.

•  Any corrosive substance.

•  Any oxidising agent.

•  Any substance liable to spontaneous combustion.

•  Any substance that changes or decomposes readily, giving out heat when doing so.

•  Any solid substance with a flash point less than 120°C.

•  Any substance that is likely to spread fire by flowing from one part of a building to another.

4. Places of special fire hazard are listed in the definitions in Appendix A.

5.  Maximum part of travel distance within the room/area. Travel distance outside the room/area should comply with the limits for the purpose group of the building or part.

B1Table 2.1 Limitations on travel distanceONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONAccess control measures

2.8  Measures to restrict access to the building (or parts of it) should not adversely affect fire safety provisions. It may be reasonable to close some escape routes outside normal business hours, but measures should remain to safely evacuate people left inside the building (see paragraph 5.6).

Number of occupants and exits

2.9  The building design should be based on the number of occupants. If the number is not known, use the appropriate floor space factors (Appendix D).

Table 2.2 gives the minimum number of escape routes and exits from a room or storey for different numbers of occupants. This number is likely to be increased by the need to observe travel distances and other practical considerations.

The width of escape routes and exits is given in paragraph 2.18.

b.  The inner room is not a bedroom.

c.  The inner room is entered directly from the access room (but not via a corridor).

d.  The escape route from the inner room does not pass through more than one access room.

e.  The travel distance from any point in the inner room to the exits from the access room does not exceed the distances in Table 2.1.

f.  The access room meets both of the following conditions.

i. ii. It is not a place of special fire hazard.

It is in the control of the same occupier.

g.  One of the following arrangements is made.

i. The enclosures (walls or partitions) of the inner room stop a minimum of 500mm below the ceiling.

ii.  The door or walls of the inner room contain a vision panel (minimum 0.1m2), so people can see if a fire starts in the access room.

iii.  The access room is fitted with an automatic fire detection and alarm system to warn occupants of the inner room if a fire starts in the access room.

2.14  Where a storey has more than one escape stair, it should be planned so that it is not necessary to pass through one stair to reach another. However, it would be acceptable to pass through one stair’s protected lobby to reach another stair.

Separation of circulation routes from protected stairways

2.15  Where they serve protected stairways that are part of primary circulation routes, self-closing fire doors should be fitted with an automatic release mechanism, to avoid them being rendered ineffective by misuse. Otherwise, the stair (and any associated exit passageway) should not form part of the primary circulation route between different parts of the building at the same level.

Storeys divided into different uses

2.16  If a storey contains areas for consuming food and/or drink, and where that is not the main use of the building, then both of the following apply.

a.  A minimum of two escape routes should be provided from each area, except from inner rooms that meet the conditions in paragraph 2.11.

b.  Those escape routes should lead directly to a storey exit without entering a kitchen or similar area of high fire hazard.

Storeys divided into different occupancies

2.17  Where a storey is divided into areas of occupancy under separate ownership or tenancy, then both of the following apply.

a.  The means of escape from each occupancy should not pass through any other occupancy.

b. If a common corridor or circulation space is on the escape route, one of the following  should apply.

i. It should be a protected corridor.

ii.  A suitable automatic fire detection and alarm system should be installed throughout  the storey.

Width of escape routes and exits

2.18  The width of escape routes and exits should meet the provisions in Table 2.3, as well as the guidance in Approved Document M.

2.19  If the maximum number of people likely to use the escape route and exit is not known, it should be calculated using the occupant number guidance in Appendix D.

2.20  Guidance on the spacing of fixed seating for auditoria is given in Annex D of BS 9999.

4.  May be reduced to 530mm for gangways between fixed storage racking, other than in public areas of ‘shop and commercial’ (purpose group 4) buildings.

5. 5mm/person does not apply to an opening serving fewer than 220 people.

Calculating exit capacity

2.21  Where multiple storey exits are available, fire might prevent one from being used. Remaining exits need to be wide enough for all occupants, so when using Table 2.3, the largest exit should be discounted.

Stairs should be at least as wide as any storey exit leading onto them. While some stairs are not subject to discounting (paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15), because the stairs will be available for other floors, the storey exits onto them are.

2.22  To calculate how many people two or more available exits (after discounting) can accommodate, add together the maximum numbers of people that each exit width can accommodate. For example, three exits each 850mm wide accommodate 33110 = 330 people.

2.23  If a ground floor storey exit and a stair share a final exit (via a ground floor lobby), then the final exit should be wide enough to evacuate people at a maximum flow rate equal to or greater than from the storey exit and stair combined (Diagram 2.6).

This can be calculated using the following formula:

W = ((N/2.5) + (60S))/80

where:

W is the width of final exit in metres

N is the number of people served by ground floor storey exit

S is the stair width in metres.

If the number of people (N) entering the lobby from the ground storey is more than 60, then the distance from the foot of the stair or the storey exit to the final exit should be a minimum of 2m (see Diagram 2.6). If that minimum distance cannot be achieved, the width of the final exit (W) should be at least the width of the stair plus the width of the storey exit.

Worked example

A ground floor storey exit serving 250 people shares a common final exit with a 1.2m wide stair.

Required final exit width = ((250/2.5) + (1.2360))/80 = 2.150m

Protected corridors

2.24  A corridor serving as part of the means of escape in any of the following circumstances should be a protected corridor.

a.  Every corridor that serves bedrooms.

b.  Every dead-end corridor (excluding recesses and extensions a maximum of 2m deep, as shown in Diagrams 2.7 and 2.8).

c.  Any corridor shared by two or more occupancies (paragraph 2.17).

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Enclosure of corridors that are not protected corridors

2.25  If a corridor is used for a means of escape but is not a protected corridor, even though the enclosing partitions may have no fire resistance, both of the following should be met to inhibit the spread of smoke.

a.  Partitions should continue to the soffit of the structural floor above, or to a suspended ceiling.

b.  Openings into rooms from the corridor should be fitted with doors, which do not need to be  fire doorsets.

Open planning will not inhibit the spread of smoke, but occupants can become aware of a fire quickly.

Division of corridors

2.26  A corridor providing access to alternative escape routes should be divided by fire doorsets fitted with a self-closing device (and associated screens) where both of the following apply.

a. It is more than 12m long.

b. It connects two or more storey exits.

The fire doorsets (including any screens) should be approximately mid-way between the two storey exits. They should safeguard the route from smoke, while considering the layout of the corridor and any adjacent fire risks.

2.27  For buildings other than dwellings (purpose groups 2 to 7): if a cavity exists above the enclosures to a corridor as described above (because the enclosures are not carried to full storey height or the underside of the roof covering at the top storey), the potential for smoke to bypass the enclosure should be restricted by one of the following methods.

a.  Method 1 – Fitting cavity barriers on the line of the enclosure(s) to and across the corridor (Diagram 2.9).

b.  Method 2 – Dividing the storey using fire resisting construction that passes through the line of the division of the corridor (Diagram 2.9). Any cavity above this division should be fitted with cavity barriers on the line of division of the storey and the corridor.

c.  Method 3 – Enclosing the cavity on the lower side by a fire resisting ceiling that extends throughout the building, compartment or separated part.

Any door that could provide a path for smoke to bypass the division should be fitted with a self-

closing device (but need not necessarily be fire resisting).

2.31  Where a storey or part of a building has multiple escape routes available, one may be over a flat roof if it does not serve a ‘residential (institutional)’ (purpose group 2(a)) building, or part of a building intended for use by members of the public.

2.32  Where an escape route over a flat roof is provided, the roof should comply with all of the following.

a. It should be part of the same building from which escape is being made.

b.  The route across the roof should lead to a storey exit or external escape route.

c.  The part of the roof forming the escape route and its supporting structure, together with any opening within 3m of the escape route, should be fire resisting (minimum REI 30).

d.  The route should be clearly defined and guarded by walls and/or protective barriers to protect from falling.

Residential care homes

General provisions

2.33  The choice of fire safety strategy depends on the way a building is designed, furnished, staffed and managed, and on the level of dependency of the residents.

2.34  In care homes for the elderly, some or all residents are likely to need help to evacuate. Buildings should generally be designed for progressive horizontal evacuation (PHE) in accordance with paragraphs 2.35 to 2.46.

For other care home types, the most appropriate of either a PHE or simultaneous evacuation strategy should be identified. The approach adopted in the design of a building must be recorded and communicated to the building management team, who can adopt procedures compatible with the building design.

Planning for progressive horizontal evacuation

2.35  The guidance below on PHE is for care homes where the provisions of the Firecode documents do not apply (see paragraph 0.10).

PHE requires areas used for the care of residents to be divided into protected areas by compartment walls and compartment floors. Protected areas provide a place of relative safety, from which further evacuation can be made if necessary.

2.36  Each storey used for the care of residents should be divided by compartment walls into at least three protected areas. All floors should be compartment floors.

2.37  Every protected area should have a minimum of two exits to adjoining protected areas. Maximum travel distances within a protected area should be both of the following.

a.  To the exit to the adjoining protected area: as shown in Table 2.1.

b.  From any point to a storey exit or a final exit: 64m.

2.38  A fire in one protected area should not prevent occupants of other areas from reaching a final  exit (Diagram 2.11). Escape routes should not pass through ancillary accommodation listed in paragraph 2.44.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 25

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION2.39  The number of residents’ beds in protected areas should be based on an assessment of both of  the following.

a.  The number of staff likely to be available.

b.  The level of assistance that residents may require. The maximum number of residents’ beds in one protected area should not exceed 10, but may need to be lower depending on the assessment.

2.40  A protected area used for horizontal evacuation from an adjoining protected area should have  a floor area able to accommodate its own occupants plus those from the largest adjoining protected area.

a.  Bedrooms: free-swing door closers.

b.  Circulation spaces: hold-open devices.

Sprinkler systems

2.46  When a sprinkler system is provided in accordance with Appendix E, the following variations to the guidance given in paragraphs 2.35 to 2.45 are acceptable.

a.  Fire doorsets to bedrooms do not need to be fitted with self-closing devices.

b.  Protected areas may contain more than 10 beds.

c.  Bedrooms may contain more than one bed.

If any of the variations are made, the management procedures should take account of the larger number of residents that may need assistance, and the need to manually close bedroom doors during sleeping hours.

Introduction

3.1  The limits on horizontal travel escape distances mean most people should be able to independently reach a protected escape route or final exit. The following guidance also includes measures for people who are unable to use stairs without help.

In larger buildings, some escape stairs may need to serve as firefighting stairs, and Section 17 will also apply.

Number of escape stairs

Mixed use buildings

3.2 If a building contains storeys, or parts of storeys, in different purpose groups, it is necessary to consider providing either of the following.

a.  Separate escape routes from the areas of different use.

b.  Other effective means to protect common escape routes.

Single escape stairs

3.3  A single escape stair may serve a building (or part of a building) in the following situations.

a.  When independent escape routes from areas in different purpose groups are not necessary  (see paragraph 3.2).

b.  From a basement that is allowed to have a single escape route in accordance with paragraph 2.6b and Table 2.1.

c. In small premises, provided it meets the conditions in paragraph 4.2.

d.  From a building that meets both of the following conditions.

i. ii. It has no storey with a floor level more than 11m above ground level.

It is allowed to have only a single escape route in every storey in accordance with paragraph 2.6b and Table 2.1.

e.  An office building with a maximum of five storeys above the ground storey where both of the following apply.

i. ii. The travel distance from every point in each storey does not exceed the distances given in Table 2.1 for escape in one direction only.

Every storey with a floor level more than 11m above ground level has an alternative means of escape.

28  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONf.  A factory comprising no more than either of the following.

i. ii. For low risk buildings, two storeys above the ground storey.

For normal risk buildings, one storey above the ground storey, provided the travel distance from every point on each storey does not exceed the distances given in Table 2.1 for escape in one direction only.

g.  Process plant buildings with a maximum of 10 people.

Provision of refuges

3.4  Refuges form part of the management plan and offer relatively safe areas for people to wait for a short period only. Refuges should meet the following conditions.

a.  Refuges should be provided on every storey (except ones consisting only of plant rooms) of each protected stairway providing an exit from that storey.

b.  Refuges do not need to be located within the stair enclosure, but should enable direct access to the stair.

c.  The number of refuge spaces does not need to equal the number of wheelchair users who may be in the building. A single refuge may be occupied by more than one person during the evacuation procedure.

3.5  The following are both examples of satisfactory refuges.

a.  An enclosure such as a compartment (Diagram 3.1), protected lobby, protected corridor or protected stairway (Diagram 3.2).

b.  An area in the open air, such as a flat roof, balcony, podium or similar place, that meets both of the following.

i. ii. It is protected (or remote) from any fire risk.

It has its own means of escape.

3.6  Refuges should be a minimum of 900mm  1400mm in size and accessible by someone in a wheelchair. Where sited in a protected stairway, protected lobby or protected corridor, they should not reduce the width of the escape route or obstruct the flow of people escaping.

3.7  Refuges should be provided with an emergency voice communication (EVC) system complying with BS 5839-9. It should consist of Type B outstations communicating with a master station in the building control room (if one exists) or next to the fire detection and alarm panel. In some buildings, wireless technology may be more appropriate.

3.8  Refuges and evacuation lifts should be clearly identified. In protected lobbies and protected stairways there should be a blue mandatory sign worded ‘Refuge – keep clear’ in addition to fire safety signs.

3.9  Paragraph 5.32 gives guidance on using lifts, including evacuation lifts, during a fire.

Width of escape stairs

3.10  The width of escape stairs should meet all of the following conditions.

It should be at least as wide as any exits giving access to the stairs.

a. 30  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

c. It should not reduce at any point on the way to a final exit.

d.  It should not exceed 1400mm in stairs taller than 30m, unless a central handrail is provided. When a central handrail is provided, the stair width on each side of it should be considered separately when assessing stair capacity.

3.11  Approved Document K requires stairs more than 2000mm wide in public buildings to have a  central handrail.

3.12  If an exit route from a stair is also the escape route from the ground storey and/or basement storey, the width of the exit route may need to be increased (see paragraph 2.23).

2. Section 6 of BS 9999 recommends that firefighting stairs should be at least 1100mm wide.

3. See Table 3.2 for the size of stairs for simultaneous evacuation, and Table 3.3 for phased evacuation.

4.  To comply with the guidance in Approved Document M on minimum widths for areas accessible to disabled people, this may need to be increased to 1000mm.

Calculation of minimum stair width

3.13  The width depends on the number of stairs provided and the escape strategy (simultaneous or phased evacuation). If the maximum number of people needing to use escape stairs is unknown, calculate it using the floor space factors in Appendix D.

Discounting of stairs

3.14  Regardless of escape strategy, where two or more stairs are provided, it should be assumed  that one might not be available during a fire. Each stair should be discounted in turn to ensure  the capacity of the remaining stairs is adequate. This applies to buildings with or without a sprinkler system.

3.15  Paragraph 3.14 does not apply if either of the following applies.

a.  Escape stairs are protected by a smoke control system designed in accordance with BS EN 12101-6.

b.  Escape stairs are approached on each storey (except the top storey) through a protected lobby.

Despite these exceptions, at least one storey exit still needs to be discounted (paragraph 2.21). Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 31

Simultaneous evacuation

3.16  The width of escape stairs should take account of the number of people using them while evacuating all storeys at the same time. The following stairs should be designed to allow simultaneous evacuation.

a.  All stairs serving basements.

b.  All stairs serving buildings with open spatial planning.

c.  All stairs serving ‘residential (other)’ (purpose group 2(b)) or ‘assembly and recreation’  (purpose group 5) buildings.

Annexes B and C of BS 9999 include designs based on simultaneous evacuation.

NOTES:

1. The capacity of stairs that serve more than 10 storeys may be obtained by using linear extrapolation.

2. The capacity of stairs not less than 1100mm wide may also be obtained by using the formulas in paragraph 3.18.

3.  Unless a central handrail is provided, stairs with a rise of more than 30m should be a maximum width of 1400mm (see paragraph 3.10).

4. Stairs wider than 2000mm should have a central handrail (see paragraph 3.11).

3.18  As an alternative to Table 3.2, the capacity of stairs 1100mm wide or wider can be found using either of the following formulas:

a.  P = 200W + 50 (W – 0.3)(N – 1)

b.  W = P + 15N – 15 / 150 + 50N

where:

32  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B1Table 3.2 Capacity of stairs for basements and for simultaneous evacuation of the buildingONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONP is the number of people that can be served

W is the width of the stair, in metres

N is the number of storeys served.

Separate calculations should be made for stairs serving basement storeys and stairs serving  upper storeys.

The population, P, should be divided by the number of available stairs.

The formula is useful to determine the width of stairs where people are not distributed evenly – either within a storey or between storeys.

In the formula, 200W represents the number of people estimated to have left the stair after 2.5 minutes of evacuation, and 50 (W – 0.3)(N – 1) represents the number of people estimated to be on the stair after 2.5 minutes of evacuation.

Worked examples

A 14 storey building contains 12 storeys of offices (ground + 11). The top two storeys contain flats that are served by separate stairs. What is the minimum width needed for the stairs that serve the office floors, for simultaneous evacuation? In the 11 above-ground-floor offices, 1200 people use the stairs. (People in the ground floor offices do not use the stairs.) In this example, two stairs are shown to satisfy the travel distance limitations.

a. The population is distributed evenly

The top office storey is at a height greater than 18m, therefore both stairs need lobby protection (see paragraph 3.34). Because both stairs are entered at each level via a protected lobby, both stairs can be assumed to be available (see paragraph 3.15).

P = 1200/2 = 600, N = 11

From the formula:

600 = 200W + 50 (W – 0.3)(11 – 1)

600 = 200W + (50W – 15)(10)

600 = 200W + 500W – 150

750 = 700W

W = 1070mm

Therefore both stairs should be at least 1070mm wide. But this needs to be increased to 1100mm, because the formula applies to stairs 1100mm wide or wider (see paragraph 3.18).

This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21. It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 110 people in Table 2.3).

b. The population is not distributed evenly

(e.g. 1000 people occupy floors 1 to 9, and 200 occupy floors 10 and 11).

The top office storey is at a height greater than 18m, therefore both stairs need lobby protection (see paragraph 3.34). Because both stairs are entered at each level via a protected lobby, both stairs can be assumed to be available (see paragraph 3.15).

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 33

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONTo find the width of:

• the stairs serving floors 10 and 11:

P = 200/2 = 100, N = 2

From the formula:

100 = 200W + 50 (W – 0.3)(2 – 1)

100 = 200W + (50W – 15)(1)

100 = 200W + 50W – 15

115 = 250W

W = 460mm

Therefore both stairs between the 9th floor landing and the top floor should be at least 460mm wide. But this needs to be increased to 1100mm, because the formula applies to stairs 1100mm wide or wider (see paragraph 3.18).

This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21. It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 100 people in Table 2.3).

• the stairs serving floors 1 to 9:

P = 1200/2 = 600, N = 9

From the formula:

600 = 200W + 50 (W – 0.3)(9 – 1)

600 = 200W + (50W – 15)(8)

600 = 200W + 400W – 120

720 = 600W

W = 1200mm

Therefore both stairs between the ninth floor landing and the ground floor should be at least 1200mm wide.

This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21. It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 134 people in Table 2.3).

Phased evacuation

3.19  Phased evacuation cannot be used in every type of building, but can be advantageous for escape stairs in high buildings. It requires supporting facilities, such as fire detection and alarm systems, to be provided and maintained.

In a phased evacuation, the first people to be evacuated are those with reduced mobility and those on the storey most immediately affected by the fire. If needed, subsequent evacuation is done two floors at a time, reducing disruption in large buildings. Phased evacuation enables stairs to be narrower than with simultaneous evacuation, and may be used for any building provided it is not identified in paragraph 3.16.

34  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION3.20  Phased evacuation in buildings with a storey over 30m in height introduces the potential for escaping people to impede firefighters entering and operating within the building. This can be addressed by consulting with the fire and rescue service about special management procedures.

In very tall buildings, typically with a storey over 45m in height, physical measures may need to be incorporated, such as by discounting a stair.

3.21  A building (or part of a building) designed for phased evacuation should satisfy all of the following criteria.

a.  At each storey except a top storey, stairs should be approached through a protected lobby or protected corridor.

b.  At each storey, the lifts should be approached through a protected lobby (see paragraph 5.37).

c.  Every floor should be a compartment floor (REI depending on height and use of the building).

d.  If there is a storey over 30m above ground level, the building should be protected throughout by an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.

e.  The building should be fitted with an appropriate fire warning system conforming to at least the L3 standard given in BS 5839-1.

f.  An internal speech communication system should provide communication between a control point at fire and rescue service access level and a fire warden on every storey. The recommendations for phased evacuation provided in BS 5839-1 should be followed. Where it is deemed appropriate to install a voice alarm, this should be in accordance with BS 5839-8.

3.22  The minimum width of stairs needed for phased evacuation is given in Table 3.3.

2.  Unless a central handrail is provided, stairs with a rise of more than 30m should be a maximum width of 1400mm (see paragraph 3.10).

3.  As an alternative to using this table, the minimum width (in mm) may be calculated from:  (P10) – 100  where P = the number of people on the most heavily occupied storey.  However, the minimum width of a stair should be 1000mm.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 35

B1Table 3.3 Minimum width of stairs designed for phased evacuationONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONWorked example using Table 3.3

What is the minimum width needed for the stairs serving a 15 storey office building (ground + 14 office floors), assuming a total population of 2500 people (excluding the ground floor population, which does not use the stairs)? To satisfy the travel distance limitations, three stairs are required.

The building is over 45m in height and designed for phased evacuation. It has been decided to discount one stair to take account of fire and rescue service operations as described in paragraph 3.20. Therefore:

• Number of people per storey = 2500/14 = 179.

Each remaining stair must be able to accommodate half the population of one storey (i.e. 90 people).

Thus each stair should be 1000mm wide (maximum capacity 100 people).

This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21. It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum width needed for 90 people in Table 2.3).

•  At least one of those stairs needs to be a firefighting stair, therefore a minimum width of 1100mm is needed (see note 2 to Table 3.1).

Additional worked example using Table 3.3

What is the minimum width needed for the stairs serving a 9 storey office building (ground + 8 office floors), assuming a total population of 1920 people (excluding the ground floor population, which does not use the stairs)? To satisfy the travel distance limitations, two stairs are required.

As both stairs need to be entered at each level through a protected lobby (see paragraph 3.21),  both stairs can be assumed to be available (see paragraph 3.15). Therefore:

• Number of people per storey = 1920/8 = 240.

•  Each stair must be able to accommodate half the population of one storey  (i.e. 240/2 = 120 people).

•  Thus both stairs would require a width of 1100mm (maximum capacity 120 people) according  to Table 3.3, but:

•  Each storey exit needs to be able to serve 240 people, because of discounting as described in paragraph 2.21. The minimum exit width needed for 240 people in Table 2.3 is 1200mm. As described in paragraph 3.10a, the stair should be at least as wide as the storey exit serving it.

• The required stair width is therefore 1200mm.

Design and protection of escape stairs

Enclosure of escape stairs

3.23  Every internal escape stair should be a protected stairway (within a fire resisting enclosure). If it is also a protected shaft (i.e. it passes from one compartment to another) or firefighting shaft, additional guidance in Sections 8 and 17 applies.

There is one exception: an unprotected stair (e.g. an accommodation stair) may form part of an internal route to a storey exit or final exit, provided that the distance of travel and the number of people involved are very limited. For example, small premises (Section 4) and raised storage areas (see paragraphs 7.6 and 7.7).

36  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONConstruction of escape stairs

3.24  The flights and landings of escape stairs should be constructed of materials achieving class A2-s3, d2 or better in all of the following situations.

a. If the escape stair is the only stair serving the building or part of the building, unless the building has two or three storeys and is an office building. b. If the escape stair is within a basement storey.

c. If the escape stair serves any storey that has a floor level more than 18m above ground or access level.

d.  If the escape stair is external, except where the stair connects the ground floor or ground level with a floor or flat roof a maximum of 6m above or below ground level.

e. If the escape stair is a firefighting stair.

Materials achieving class B-s3, d2 or worse may be added to the top horizontal surface, except on firefighting stairs.

3.25  Further guidance on firefighting stairs is given in Section 17. Dimensional constraints on the design of stairs are given in Approved Document K.

Single steps

3.26  Single steps on escape routes should be prominently marked. A single step on the line of a doorway is acceptable, subject to paragraph 5.22.

Helical stairs and spiral stairs 3.27  Helical stairs and spiral stairs may form part of an escape route provided they are designed in accordance with BS 5395-2. If they are intended to serve members of the public, stairs should be type E (public) stairs.

Fixed ladders 3.28  Fixed ladders should not be provided as a means of escape for members of the public. They should only be provided where a conventional stair is impractical, such as for access to plant rooms which are not normally occupied.

External walls adjacent to protected stairways

3.29  With some configurations of external wall, a fire in one part of a building could subject the external wall of a protected stairway to heat (for example, where the two are adjacent at an internal angle in the façade, as shown in Diagram 3.3).

3.30  If a protected stairway projects beyond, is recessed from or is in an internal angle of the adjoining external wall of the building, then the minimum distance between an unprotected area of the building enclosure and an unprotected area of the stair enclosure should be 1800mm.

External escape stairs

3.31  Where a storey or part of the building has more than one escape route available, some of the escape routes may be via an external escape stair, provided the following conditions are met.

a.  There is at least one internal escape stair from every part of each storey (excluding plant areas).

b. c. In the case of an ‘assembly and recreation’ (purpose group 5) building, the route is not intended for use by the public.

In the case of a ‘residential (institutional)’ (purpose group 2(a)) building, the route serves only office or residential staff accommodation.

3.32  Any external escape stair should meet all of the following conditions (Diagram 3.4).

a.  Doors to the stair should be fire resisting (minimum E 30) and be fitted with a self-closing device, except for a single exit door from the building to the top landing of a downward-

leading external stair, provided it is the only door onto the landing.

b.  Fire resisting construction (minimum RE 30) is required for the building envelope within the following zones, measured from the flights and landings of the external stair.

i. ii. iii. 1800mm above and horizontally.

3.35  A protected lobby should be provided between an escape stair and a place of special fire hazard to protect from the ingress of smoke. The lobby should have a minimum 0.4m2 of permanent ventilation, or be protected by a mechanical smoke control system.

Exits from protected stairways

3.36  Every protected stairway should lead to a final exit, either directly or via an exit passageway. Any protected exit corridor or stair should have the same standard of fire resistance and lobby protection as the stair it serves. The exit from a protected stairway should comply with paragraphs 5.20 to 5.24.

Separation of adjoining protected stairways

3.37  The construction separating two adjacent protected stairways (or exit passageways) leading to different final exits should be imperforate.

Use of space within protected stairways

3.38  A protected stairway may only include any of the following.

a.  Sanitary accommodation or washrooms, as long as the accommodation is not used as a cloakroom. A gas water heater or sanitary towel incinerator may be installed in the accommodation, but no other gas appliance.

b. If the protected stairway is not a firefighting stair: a lift well.

c. If the protected stairway is not the only stair serving the building or part of the building: a reception desk or enquiry office area at ground or access level. The reception or enquiry office area should have a maximum area of 10m2.

4.1  A ‘small premises’ is generally limited both in its size and in its number of occupants. When undivided, all of its parts are likely to be clearly visible to occupants. Occupants of small premises will be able to reach an exit quickly in an emergency and therefore a reduction in the number of exits and stairs is acceptable. This guidance is not applicable to small premises where highly flammable materials are sold, stored  or used.

4.2  Small premises should meet all of the following general conditions.

a.  i.  It should be single occupancy.

ii. It should not comprise more than a basement storey, ground storey and first storey.

iii.  No storey should have a floor area more than 280m2.

b.  Any kitchen or other open cooking arrangements should be at the extremity of any dead end remote from the exits.

c.  For a bar or restaurant, the seating or standing accommodation (Table D1) should be planned for a maximum of 30 people per storey. The seating or standing accommodation for the ground storey may be planned for 100 people if it has a final exit independent of the stair.

4.3  The following paragraphs only apply in place of those provisions elsewhere in this Approved Document which relate to the following.

a.  The number and position of exits and protected stairways.

b.  Measuring distances of travel.

c.  Open escape stairs.

For provisions other than those listed above, the guidance elsewhere in this Approved Document should be followed.

Construction

4.4  Except in kitchens, ancillary offices and stores, floor areas should be undivided so exits are clearly visible from all parts.

4.5  Store rooms should be enclosed with fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30).

Travel distance and number of escape routes

4.6  Escape routes should be sited so that the travel distance from any point of a storey to the nearest storey exit does not exceed the distance given in Table 4.1 (see Diagrams 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3). The siting of two or more exits or stairs should give effective alternative directions of travel from any point in a storey.

ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONSection 5: General provisions

Introduction

5.1  This section applies to all buildings and deals with the design, construction and protection of escape routes and service installations.

Protection of escape routes

Fire resistance of enclosures

5.2  Fire resistance test criteria are set out in Appendix B. Standards of performance are summarised in Tables B3 and B4. Apart from specific situations described in Sections 1 and 2, and requirements B3 and B5, a minimum performance of REI 30 is sufficient to protect means of escape. Fire resistance of doors

5.3  Fire resistance test criteria are set out in Appendix C. Standards of performance are summarised in Table C1.

Fire resistance of glazed elements

5.4 If glazed elements in fire resisting enclosures and doors can only meet the required integrity performance, their use is limited. These limitations depend on whether the enclosure forms part of a protected shaft (see Section 8) and the provisions set out in Appendix B, Table B5. If both integrity and insulation performance can be met, there is no restriction in this document on the use or amount of glass.

5.5  Glazed elements should also comply with the following, where necessary.

a. If the enclosure forms part of a protected shaft: Section 8.

b.  Appendix B, Table B5.

c.  Guidance on the safety of glazing: Approved Document K.

Doors on escape routes

5.6  Doors should be readily openable to avoid undue delay to people escaping. Doors on escape routes (both within and from the building) should comply with paragraphs 5.7 to 5.15. Guidance on door closing and ‘hold open’ devices for fire doorsets is set out in Appendix C.

Door fastenings

5.7 In general, doors on escape routes (whether or not the doors are fire doorsets) should be either  of the following.

a.  Not fitted with a lock, latch or bolt fastenings.

b.  Fitted only with simple fastenings that are all of the following.

i. Easy to operate; it should be apparent how to undo the fastening.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 47

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONii.  Operable from the side approached by people escaping.

iii.  Operable without a key.

iv.  Operable without requiring people to manipulate more than one mechanism. Doors may be fitted with hardware to allow them to be locked when rooms are empty. In places such as hotel bedrooms, locks may be fitted that are key operated from the outside and manually opened from the inside.

If a secure door is operated by code or combination keypad, swipe or proximity card, biometric data, etc., a security mechanism override should be possible from the side approached by people escaping.

5.8  Electrically powered locks should return to the unlocked position in all of the following situations.

a. If the fire detection and alarm system operates.

b. If there is loss of power or system error.

c. If the security mechanism override is activated.

Security mechanism overrides for electrically powered locks should be a Type A call point as described in BS 7273-4. The call point should be positioned on the side approached by people escaping. If the door provides escape in either direction, a call point should be installed on both sides of the door.

5.9 In places of assembly and shop and commercial buildings (purpose groups 4 and 5), doors on escape routes from rooms with more than 60 people should be either of the following.

a.  Not fitted with locks, latches or bolts.

b.  Fitted with panic fastenings in accordance with BS EN 1125.

In non-residential buildings (purpose groups 3 to 7), some final exit doors feature security locks that are used only when the building is empty. Such locks may be appropriate, but management procedures must emphasise their safe use.

5.10  Guidance on door closing and ‘hold open’ devices for fire doorsets is set out in Appendix C.

Direction of opening

5.11  The door of any doorway or exit should be hung to open in the direction of escape whenever reasonably practicable. It should always be hung to open in the direction of escape if either of the following conditions applies. a.  More than 60 people might be expected to use it during a fire.

b.  There is a very high risk of fire with potential for rapid fire growth, such as with some  industrial activities.

Amount of opening and effect on associated escape routes

5.12  All doors on escape routes should be hung to meet both of the following conditions.

a.  Open by a minimum of 90 degrees.

b.  Open with a swing that complies with both of the following.

i. Is clear of any change of floor level, other than a threshold or single step on the line  of the doorway.

ii.  Does not reduce the effective width of any escape route across a landing.

48  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION5.13  Any door opening towards a corridor or a stair should be recessed to prevent its swing encroaching on the effective width.

Vision panels in doors

5.14  Doors should contain vision panels in both of the following situations.

a.  Where doors on escape routes divide corridors.

b.  Where doors are hung to swing both ways. Approved Document M contains guidance about vision panels in doors across accessible corridors and Approved Document K contains guidance about the safety of glazing.

Revolving and automatic doors

5.15  Where revolving doors, automatic doors and turnstiles are placed across escape routes they should comply with one of the following.

a.  They are automatic doors of the required width and comply with one of the following conditions.

i. ii. Their failsafe system provides outward opening from any open position.

They have a monitored failsafe system to open the doors if the mains electricity supply fails.

iii.  They failsafe to the open position if the power fails.

b.  Non-automatic swing doors of the required width are provided immediately adjacent to the revolving or automatic door or turnstile.

General provisions

Headroom in escape routes

5.16  Escape routes should have a minimum clear headroom of 2m. The only projections allowed below this height are door frames.

Flooring of escape routes

5.17  Escape route floor finishes should minimise their slipperiness when wet. Finishes include the treads of steps and surfaces of ramps and landings.

Ramps and sloping floors

5.18  A ramp forming part of an escape route should meet the provisions in Approved Document M. Any sloping floor or tier should have a pitch of not more than 35 degrees to the horizontal.

5.19  Guidance for where there is fixed seating is given in both of the following.

a.  Approved Documents K and M give guidance on the design of ramps and associated landings, and on aisles and gangways where there is fixed seating.

b.  Section 2 of this document refers to Annex D of BS 9999, which gives guidance on the design of means of escape in places with fixed seating.

Final exits

5.20  The width of a final exit should be at least the same as the minimum required width of the escape route it serves.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 49

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION5.21  People should be able to rapidly leave the area around the building. Direct access to a street, passageway, walkway or open space should be available. The route away from the building should comply with the following.

a.  Be well defined.

b. If necessary, have suitable guarding.

5.22  Final exits should not present a barrier for disabled people. Where the route to a final exit does not include stairs, a level threshold and, where necessary, a ramp should be provided.

5.23  Final exit locations should be clearly visible and recognisable.

5.24  Final exits should avoid outlets of basement smoke vents and openings to transformer chambers, refuse chambers, boiler rooms and similar risks.

B1Table 5.1 Provisions for escape lightingONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONLighting of escape routes

5.25  All escape routes should have adequate artificial lighting. If the mains electricity power supply fails, escape lighting should illuminate the routes listed in Table 5.1.

5.26  Escape stair lighting should be on a separate circuit from the electricity supply to any other part of the escape route.

5.27  Escape lighting should conform to BS 5266-1.

Exit signs

5.28  Every doorway or other exit providing access to a means of escape, other than exits in ordinary use (e.g. main entrances), should be distinctively and conspicuously marked by an exit sign in accordance with BS ISO 3864-1 and BS 5499-4.

Advice on fire safety signs, including emergency escape signs, is given in the HSE publication Safety Signs and Signals: Guidance on Regulations.

Some buildings may require additional signs to comply with other legislation.

Protected power circuits

5.29  To limit potential damage to cables in protected circuits, all of the following should apply.

a.  Cables should be sufficiently robust.

b.  Cable routes should be carefully selected and/or physically protected in areas where cables may be exposed to damage.

c.  Methods of cable support should be class A1 rated and offer at least the same integrity as the cable. They should maintain circuit integrity and hold cables in place when exposed to fire. 5.30  A protected circuit to operate equipment during a fire should achieve all of the following. a.  Cables should achieve PH 30 classification when tested in accordance with BS EN 50200 (incorporating Annex E) or an equivalent standard.

b. It should only pass through parts of the building in which the fire risk is negligible.

c. It should be separate from any circuit provided for another purpose.

5.31  Guidance on cables for large and complex buildings is given in BS 5839-1, BS 5266-1 and BS 8519.

Lifts

Evacuation lifts

5.32  Generally, lifts should not be used when there is a fire in the building, unless their use forms part  of a management plan for evacuating people and the following conditions are met.

a.  Lifts are appropriately sited and protected.

b.  Lifts contain safety features to ensure they remain usable during a fire.

Guidance on the design and use of evacuation lifts is given in Annex G to BS 9999.

5.33  Where a firefighting lift is provided, it can be used to evacuate disabled people. Management plans should describe how this would be managed, and what will happen when the fire and rescue service arrives.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 51

B1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONFire protection of lift installations

5.34  Lift wells should comply with one of the following conditions.

a.  Be sited within the enclosures of a protected stairway.

b.  Be enclosed with fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30) when in a position that might prejudice the means of escape.

5.35  A lift well connecting different compartments should form a protected shaft (see Section 8).

5.36  Lifts that rise within a large volume such as a mall or atrium and do not have a conventional well, such as wall-climber or feature lifts, may be at risk if they run through a smoke reservoir. Care should be taken to maintain the integrity of the smoke reservoir and protect people in the lift.

5.37  In buildings designed for phased evacuation or progressive horizontal evacuation, if the lift well is not within the enclosures of a protected stairway, its entrance should be separated at every storey by a protected lobby (minimum REI 30).

5.38  In basements and enclosed car parks, the lift should be within the enclosure of a protected stairway. Otherwise, the lift should be approached only via a protected lobby or protected corridor (minimum REI 30).

5.39  If a lift delivers into a protected corridor or protected lobby serving sleeping accommodation and also serves a storey containing a high fire risk (such as a kitchen, communal areas, stores, etc.) then the lift should be separated from the high fire risk area(s) by a protected lobby or protected corridor (minimum REI 30).

5.40  A lift shaft serving storeys above ground level should not serve any basement if either of the following applies.

a.  There is only one escape stair serving storeys above ground level and smoke from a basement fire would adversely affect escape routes in the upper storeys.

b.  The lift shaft is within the enclosure to an escape stair that terminates at ground level.

5.41  Lift machine rooms should be sited over the lift well where possible. Where buildings or part of a building with only one stairway make this arrangement impractical, the lift machine room should be sited outside the protected stairway.

Refuse chutes and storage

5.42  Refuse storage chambers, refuse chutes and refuse hoppers should be sited and constructed in accordance with BS 5906.

5.43  Refuse chutes and rooms for storing refuse should meet both of the following conditions.

a.  Be separated from other parts of the building by fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30  in buildings with a top storey up to 5m above ground level; otherwise REI 60).

b.  Not be situated within a protected stairway or protected lobby.

5.44  The approach to rooms containing refuse chutes or for storing refuse should comply with one  of the following conditions. a.  Be directly from the open air.

b.  Be through a protected lobby with a minimum 0.2m2 of permanent ventilation.

5.45  Access openings to refuse storage chambers should not be sited next to escape routes or  final exits.

This section deals with the following requirement from Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.

Limits on application

Requirement

Requirement

Internal fire spread (linings)

B2. (1)   To inhibit the spread of fire within the building, the internal linings shall—

 (a)   adequately resist the spread of flame over their surfaces; and

 (b)   have, if ignited, either a rate of heat release or a rate of fire growth, which is reasonable in the circumstances.

(2)   In this paragraph “internal linings” means the materials or products used in lining any partition, wall, ceiling or other internal structure.

Intention

In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B2 is met by achieving a restricted spread of flame over internal linings. The building fabric should make a limited contribution to fire growth, including a low rate of heat release.

It is particularly important in circulation spaces, where linings may offer the main means by which fire spreads and where rapid spread is most likely to prevent occupants from escaping.

Requirement B2 does not include guidance on the following.

a.  Generation of smoke and fumes.

b.  The upper surfaces of floors and stairs.

c.  Furniture and fittings. 54  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

These sections deal with the following requirement from Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.

Limits on application

Requirement B3(3) does not apply to material alterations to any prison provided under section 33 of the Prison Act 1952.

Requirement

Requirement

Internal fire spread (structure)

B3. (1)   The building shall be designed and constructed so that, in the event of fire, its stability will be maintained for a reasonable period

(2)   A wall common to two or more buildings shall be designed and constructed so that it adequately resists the spread of fire between those buildings. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph a house in a terrace and a semi-detached house are each to be treated as a separate building.

(3)   Where reasonably necessary to inhibit the spread of fire within the building, measures shall be taken, to an extent appropriate to the size and intended use of the building, comprising either or both of the following—

(a)   sub-division of the building with fire-resisting construction;

(b)   installation of suitable automatic fire suppression systems.

 (4)   The building shall be designed and constructed so that the unseen spread of fire and smoke within concealed spaces in its structure and fabric is inhibited.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 61

B3ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Intention

In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B3 is met by achieving all of the following.

a.  For defined periods, loadbearing elements of structure withstand the effects of fire without loss of stability.

b.  Compartmentation of buildings by fire resisting construction elements.

c.  Automatic fire suppression is provided where it is necessary.

d.  Protection of openings in fire-separating elements to maintain continuity of the fire separation.

e. Inhibition of the unseen spread of fire and smoke in cavities, to reduce the risk of structural failure and spread of fire and smoke, where they pose a threat to the safety of people in and around the building.

The extent to which any of these measures are necessary is dependent on the use of the building and, in some cases, its size, and on the location of the elements of construction. 62  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B3ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONSection 7: Loadbearing elements of structure

Fire resistance standard

7.1 Elements of structure such as structural frames, beams, columns, loadbearing walls (internal and external), floor structures and gallery structures should have, as a minimum, the fire resistance given in Appendix B, Table B3.

7.2  Appendix B includes guidance on all of the following.

a.  Provisions to ensure that where one element of structure supports or stabilises another element of structure, the supporting element has no less fire resistance than the other element (see Table B4).

b.  Measures so that elements common to more than one building or compartment are constructed to the standard of the more onerous of the relevant provisions.

c.  Special provisions about fire resistance of elements of structure in single storey buildings.

d.  Concessions in respect of fire resistance of elements of structure in basements where one or more sides of the basement are open at ground level.

Exclusions from the provisions for elements of structure

7.3  The following are excluded from the definition of ‘element of structure’.

a.  A structure that supports only a roof, unless either of the following applies.

i. The roof performs the function of a floor, such as for parking vehicles, or as a means  of escape.

ii.  The structure is essential for the stability of an external wall that needs to be fire  resisting (e.g. to achieve compartmentation or for the purposes of preventing fire spread between buildings).

b.  The lowest floor of the building.

c.  A platform floor.

d.  A loading gallery, fly gallery, stage grid, lighting bridge or any gallery provided for similar purposes or for maintenance and repair.

e.  External walls, such as curtain walls or other forms of cladding, which transmit only self weight and wind loads and do not transmit floor load.

NOTE: In some cases, structural members within a roof may be essential for the structural stability system of the building. In these cases, the structural members in the roof do not just support a roof  and must demonstrate the relevant fire resistance for the building as required by paragraph 7.2a above. Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 63

B3ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONAdditional guidance

7.4 If a loadbearing wall is any of the following, guidance in other sections may also apply.

a.  A compartment wall (including a wall common to two buildings): Section 8.

b.  Enclosing a place of special fire hazard: Section 8, paragraph 8.7.

c.  Protecting a means of escape: Sections 2 to 5.

d.  An external wall: Sections 12 and 13.

e.  Enclosing a firefighting shaft: Section 17.

7.5 If a floor is also a compartment floor, see Section 8.

Raised storage areas

7.6  The normal provisions for fire resistance may be too onerous to apply to raised, free-standing floors (sometimes supported by racking) in single storey buildings used for industrial and storage purposes. The introduction of raised storage areas can alter the effective number of storeys in the building (see the definition of ‘storey’ in Appendix A).

7.7  A structure that does not have the minimum fire resistance specified in Appendix B, Table B4,  is acceptable if it satisfies all of the following conditions.

a.  The structure meets both of the following conditions.

i. ii. It has only one tier.

It is used for storage purposes only.

b.  The people likely to be on the floor at any one time are both of the following.

i. Few in number.

ii.  Not members of the public.

c.  The floor is open above and below to the room or space in which it is situated.

d.  The means of escape from the floor is in accordance with Sections 2 to 5.

e.  The floor meets both of the following conditions.

i. ii. It is not more than 10m in width or length.

It is a maximum of half the floor area of the space in which it is situated.

The limitations in (e) may be adjusted if any of the following apply.

f. g. If the lower level has an automatic fire detection and alarm system meeting the recommendations of BS 5839-1, then the floor size may be increased to not more than 20m in either width or length.

If agreed with the building control body and the fire and rescue service, then it may be possible to vary this dimension and area. However, the safety of firefighters and the distance they may need to travel over or under the floor must be considered.

h. If the building is fitted throughout with an automatic sprinkler system complying with Appendix E, then no limits are set for the size of the floor.

Provision of compartmentation

All purpose groups

8.1  All of the following should be provided as compartment walls and compartment floors and should have, as a minimum, the fire resistance given in Appendix B, Table B3. 8.2  A wall common to two or more buildings should be a compartment wall.

8.3  Parts of a building occupied mainly for different purposes should be separated from one another by compartment walls and/or compartment floors. Compartmentation is not needed if one of the different purposes is ancillary to the other. See paragraphs 0.23 and 0.24.

8.4  Effective compartmentation relies on both of the following.

a.  Fire resistance should be continuous at the join between elements forming a compartment.

b.  Any openings between two compartments should not reduce the fire resistance.

8.5  The lowest floor in a building does not need to be a compartment floor.

Protected shafts

8.6  Stairs and service shafts connecting compartments should be protected to restrict the spread of fire between the compartments. These are called protected shafts. Walls or floors surrounding a protected shaft are considered to be compartment walls or compartment floors.

Places of special fire hazard

8.7  Fire resisting construction enclosing these places should achieve minimum REI 30. These walls and floors are not compartment walls and compartment floors.

‘Residential (institutional)’ buildings including health care

8.8  All floors should be constructed as compartment floors.

8.9  Paragraphs 2.35 and 2.36 give guidance on the provisions for compartment walls in care homes that use progressive horizontal evacuation.

‘Residential (other)’ buildings

8.10  In ‘residential (other)’ (purpose group (2(b)) buildings, all floors should be compartment floors.

B3ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONNon‑residential buildings

8.11 In buildings in a non-residential purpose group (purpose groups 3 to 7), the following should be compartment walls and compartment floors.

a.  Every wall needed to divide the building to observe the compartment size limits in Table 8.1 (Diagram 8.1a).

b.  Every floor, if the building or separated part of the building (see paragraph 8.19) has a top storey that is more than 30m above ground level (Diagram 8.1b).

c.  The floor of the ground storey, if the building has one or more basements (Diagram 8.1c), except in small premises (see paragraph 4.2).

d.  The floor of every basement storey (except the lowest floor), if the building or separated part has a basement more than 10m below ground level (Diagram 8.1d).

e. If the building comprises ‘shop and commercial’, ‘industrial’ or ‘storage’ premises (purpose groups 4, 6, 7): every wall or floor dividing a building into separate occupancies (spaces used by different organisations, whether they fall within the same purpose group or not).

f.  See also the provision in paragraph 5.46 for store rooms in shops to be separated from retail areas by fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30).

8.12  In two storey ‘shop and commercial’ or ‘industrial’ buildings (purpose groups 4 or 6), where the use of the upper storey is ancillary to the use of the ground storey, the ground storey may be treated as a single storey building for fire compartmentation purposes where all of the following apply.

a.  The area of the upper storey does not exceed the lower of:

i. ii. 20% of the area of the ground storey

500m2.

b.  The upper storey is compartmented from the lower one.

c.  The upper storey has a means of escape independent of the lower storey escape routes.

Every place of special fire hazard (see Appendix E) should be enclosed with fire resisting construction.

8.14  Buildings within the ‘office’, ‘shop and commercial’, ‘assembly and recreation’, ‘industrial’ and ‘storage and other non-residential’ (except car parks for light vehicles) purpose groups (purpose groups 3 to 7(a)) require sprinklers where there is a top storey above 30m. The sprinkler system should be provided in accordance with Appendix E.

Construction of compartment walls and compartment floors

General provisions

8.15  All compartment walls and compartment floors should achieve both of the following.

a.  Form a complete barrier to fire between the compartments they separate.

b.  Have the appropriate fire resistance, as given in Appendix B, Tables B3 and B4.

8.16  Timber beams, joists, purlins and rafters may be built into or carried through a masonry or concrete compartment wall if the openings for them are both of the following.

a.  As small as practicable.

b.  Fire-stopped. If trussed rafters bridge the wall, failure of the truss due to a fire in one compartment should not cause failure of the truss in another compartment.

8.17  Where services could provide a source of ignition, the risk of fire developing and spreading into adjacent compartments should be controlled.

Compartment walls between buildings

8.18  Adjoining buildings should only be separated by walls, not floors. Compartment walls common to two or more buildings should comply with both of the following.

a.  Run the full height of the building in a continuous vertical plane.

b.  Be continued through any roof space to the underside of the roof.

Separated parts of buildings

8.19  Compartment walls forming a separated part of a building should run the full height of the building in a continuous vertical plane. Separated parts can be assessed independently to determine the appropriate standard of fire resistance in each. The two separated parts can have different standards of fire resistance.

Other compartment walls

8.20  Compartment walls not described in paragraphs 8.18 and 8.19 should run the full height of the storey in which they are situated.

8.21  Compartment walls in a top storey beneath a roof should be continued through the roof space.

Junction of compartment wall or compartment floor with other walls

8.22  At the junction with another compartment wall or an external wall, the fire resistance of the compartmentation should be maintained. Fire-stopping that meets the provisions in paragraphs 10.24 to 10.29 should be provided.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 69

B3ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION8.23  At the junction of a compartment floor and an external wall with no fire resistance, the external wall should be restrained at floor level. The restraint should reduce movement of the wall away from the floor if exposed to fire.

8.24  Compartment walls should be able to accommodate deflection of the floor, when exposed to fire, by either of the following means.

a.  Between the wall and floor, provide a head detail that is capable of maintaining its integrity while deforming.

b.  Design the wall so it maintains its integrity by resisting the additional vertical load from the floor above.

Where compartment walls are located within the middle half of a floor between vertical supports, the deflection may be assumed to be 40mm unless a smaller value can be justified by assessment. Outside this area, the limit can be reduced linearly to zero at the supports. For steel beams that do not have the required fire resistance, reference should be made to SCI Publication P288.

Junction of compartment wall with roof

8.25  A compartment wall should achieve both of the following.

a.  Meet the underside of the roof covering or deck, with fire-stopping to maintain the continuity of fire resistance.

b.  Be continued across any eaves.

8.26  To reduce the risk of fire spreading over the roof from one compartment to another, a 1500mm wide zone of the roof, either side of the wall, should have a covering classified as BROOF(t4), on a substrate or deck of a material rated class A2-s3, d2 or better, as set out in Diagram 8.2a. Thermoplastic rooflights that, because of paragraph 14.7, are regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification are not suitable for use in that zone.

8.27  Materials achieving class B-s3, d2 or worse used as a substrate to the roof covering and any timber tiling battens, fully bedded in mortar or other suitable material for the width of the wall (Diagram 8.2b), may extend over the compartment wall in buildings that are both of the following.

a.  A maximum of 15m high.

b. In one of the following purpose groups.

i. All residential purpose groups (purpose groups 1 and 2) other than ‘residential (institutional)’ (purpose group 2(a)).

ii. ‘Office’ (purpose group 3).

iii. ‘Assembly and recreation’ (purpose group 5).

8.28  Double-skinned insulated roof sheeting should incorporate a band of material rated class A2-s3, d2 or better, a minimum of 300mm in width, centred over the wall.

8.29  As an alternative to the provisions of paragraph 8.26 or 8.27, the compartment wall may extend through the roof for a minimum of either of the following (see Diagram 8.2c).

a.  Where the height difference between the two roofs is less than 375mm, 375mm above the top surface of the adjoining roof covering.

the cavity is not normally accessible by people, unless there are openings in the floor such that it is possible for materials to accumulate in the cavity (in which case cavity barriers should be provided and access should be provided to the cavity for cleaning).

9.11 If a single room with a ceiling cavity or underfloor cavity exceeds the dimensions in Table 9.1, cavity barriers need only be provided on the line of the enclosing walls/partitions of that room, if both of the following apply.

a.  The cavity barriers are a maximum of 40m apart.

b.  The surface of the material/product exposed in the cavity is class C-s3, d2 or better.

9.12  If the cavity is over an undivided area that exceeds 40m in any direction, there is no limit to its size if all of the following conditions are met. a.  Together, the room and cavity form a compartment separated from the rest of the building.

b.  Both of the following apply.

i. The building is fitted with an automatic fire detection and alarm system that conforms  to BS 5839-1.

c. ii.  Detectors are only required in the cavity to satisfy BS 5839-1.

i. The exposed surface of the material/product used in the construction of the cavity is  class B-s3, d2 or better.

ii.  The supports and fixings in the cavity are class A1.

e.  Any pipe insulation system should achieve class C-s3, d2 rating or better.

f.  Any electrical wiring in the cavity is laid in metal trays or metal conduit.

g.  Other than those in (d)–(f), any materials are class A2-s3, d2 rated or better.

Construction and fixings for cavity barriers

9.13  Cavity barriers, tested from each side separately, should provide a minimum of both of the following: a.  30 minutes’ integrity (E 30)

b.  15 minutes’ insulation (I 15).

They may be formed by a construction provided for another purpose if it achieves the same performance.

9.14  Cavity barriers in a stud wall or partition, or provided around openings, may be formed of any of the following. a.  Steel, a minimum of 0.5mm thick. b.  Timber, a minimum of 38mm thick. c.  Polythene-sleeved mineral wool, or mineral wool slab, under compression when installed in  the cavity.

B3ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONd.  Calcium silicate, cement-based or gypsum-based boards, a minimum of 12mm thick.

These do not necessarily achieve the performance specified in paragraph 9.13. NOTE: Cavity barriers provided around openings may be formed by the window or door frame if the frame is constructed of steel or timber of the minimum thickness in (a) or (b), as appropriate. 9.15  Cavity barriers should be tightly fitted to a rigid construction and mechanically fixed in position. If this is not possible (e.g. where a cavity barrier joins to slates, tiles, corrugated sheeting or similar materials) the junction should be fire-stopped.

9.16  Cavity barriers should be fixed so their performance is unlikely to be made ineffective by any of the following.

a.  Movement of the building due to subsidence, shrinkage or temperature change, and movement of the external envelope due to wind.

b.  During a fire, collapse of services penetrating the cavity barriers, either by the failure of the supporting system or through degradation of the service itself (e.g. by melting or burning).

c.  During a fire, failure of the cavity barrier fixings. (In roof spaces, where cavity barriers are fixed to roof members, there is no expectation of fire resistance from roof members provided for the purpose of support.)

d.  During a fire, failure of any material or construction to which cavity barriers abut. (For example, a suspended ceiling that continues over a fire resisting wall or partition collapses, and the cavity barrier fails prematurely because the ceiling was not designed to provide a minimum fire resistance of EI 30.)

Openings in cavity barriers

9.17  Openings should be limited to the following.

a.  Fire doorsets with a minimum rating of E 30, fitted in accordance with Appendix C.

b.  The passage of pipes that follow the provisions in Section 10.

d.  Openings fitted with a suitably mounted and appropriate fire damper.

e.  Ducts that are either of the following.

i. ii. Fire resisting (minimum E 30).

Fitted with a suitably mounted and appropriate fire damper where they pass through the cavity barrier.

9.18  If a cavity barrier is provided above or below a partition between bedrooms in ‘residential (institutional)’ and ‘residential (other)’ (purpose groups 2(a) and 2(b)) buildings, and the partition is not a fire resisting partition, then paragraph 9.17 does not apply. However, both of the following apply.

a.  The number of openings in the barrier should be kept to a minimum.

b.  Any penetrations should be sealed to restrict the passage of smoke with an appropriate  fire-stopping material.

NOTE: For further guidance on openings in cavity barriers see Section 10.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 81

B3ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONSection 10: Protection of openings and fire‑stopping

Introduction

10.1  Every joint, imperfect fit and opening for services through a fire-separating element should be sealed with fire-stopping to ensure the fire resistance of the element is not impaired. Fire-stopping delays the spread of fire and, generally, the spread of smoke as well. Openings for pipes

10.2  Pipes passing through a fire-separating element, unless in a protected shaft, should comply with one of the alternatives A, B or C below.

Alternative A: Proprietary seals (any pipe diameter)

10.3  Provide a proprietary, tested sealing system that will maintain the fire resistance of the wall, floor or cavity barrier.

Alternative B: Pipes with a restricted diameter

10.4  Where a proprietary sealing system is not used, fire-stop around the pipe, keeping the opening for the pipe as small as possible. The nominal internal diameter of the pipe should not exceed the relevant dimension given in Table 10.1. Alternative C: Sleeving

10.5  A pipe with a maximum nominal internal diameter of 160mm may be used with a sleeve made out of a high melting point metal, as shown in Diagram 10.1, if the pipe is made of one of the following.

a.  Lead.

b.  Aluminium.

c.  Aluminium alloy.

d.  Fibre-cement.

e.  uPVC (pipes should also comply with either BS 4514 or BS 5255).

A high melting point metal means any metal (such as cast iron, copper or steel) which, if exposed to a temperature of 800°C, will not soften or fracture to the extent that flame or hot gas will pass through the wall of the pipe.

Mechanical ventilation and air‑conditioning systems

General provisions

10.6  Ductwork should not help to transfer fire and smoke through the building. Terminals of exhaust points should be sited away from final exits, cladding or roofing materials achieving class B-s3, d2 or worse and openings into the building.

10.7  Ventilation ducts supplying or extracting air directly to or from a protected stairway should not also serve other areas. A separate ventilation system should be provided for each protected stairway.

10.8  A fire and smoke damper should be provided where ductwork enters or leaves each section of the protected escape route it serves. It should be operated by a smoke detector or suitable fire detection system. Fire and smoke dampers should close when smoke is detected. Alternatively, the methods set out in paragraphs 10.15 and 10.16 and Diagrams 10.2 and 10.3 may be followed. Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 83

B3Table 10.1  Maximum nominal internal diameter of pipes passing through a  fire-separating elementONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 10.9  In a system that recirculates air, smoke detectors should be fitted in the extract ductwork before both of the following.

a.  The point where recirculated air is separated from air to be discharged to the outside.

b.  Any filters or other air cleaning equipment. When smoke is detected, detectors should do one of the following. a.  Cause the system to immediately shut down.

b.  Switch the ventilation system from recirculating mode to extraction to divert smoke outside the building.

10.10 Non-domestic kitchens, car parks and plant rooms should have separate and independent extraction systems. Extracted air should not be recirculated.

10.11  Under fire conditions, ventilation and air-conditioning systems should be compatible with smoke control systems and need to be considered in their respective design.

Ventilation ducts and flues passing through fire‑separating elements

General provisions

10.12  If air handling ducts pass through fire-separating elements, the fire performance of the elements should be maintained using one or more of the following four methods. In most ductwork systems, a combination of the four methods is best. a.  Method 1 – thermally activated fire dampers. b.  Method 2 – fire resisting enclosures. c.  Method 3 – protection using fire resisting ductwork. d.  Method 4 – automatically activated fire and smoke dampers triggered by smoke detectors. 10.13  Further information on fire resisting ductwork is given in the ASFP Blue Book.

Kitchen extract 10.14  Methods 1 and 4 should not be used for extract ductwork serving kitchens. The likely build-up of grease within the duct can adversely affect dampers.

Ducts passing through protected escape routes

10.15  Method 1 should not be used for extract ductwork passing through the enclosures of protected escape routes (Diagrams 10.2 and 10.3), as large volumes of smoke can pass thermal devices without triggering them.

10.16 An ES classified fire and smoke damper which is activated by a suitable fire detection system (method 4) may also be used for protected escape routes. 84  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

11.1  Car parks call for different measures to restrict fire spread within buildings for the following reasons.

a.  The fire load is well defined.

b.  The probability of fire spreading from one storey to another in a well ventilated car park is low. Guidance is therefore given for three ventilation scenarios.

Open‑sided car parks Natural ventilation

11.2  For the purposes of assessing fire resistance, a building, compartment or separated part containing a car park may be regarded as open-sided when it complies with all of the following.

a.  There are no basement storeys.

b.  Each storey is naturally ventilated by permanent openings at each car parking level. The aggregate vent area is a minimum of 1/20 of that level’s floor area, at least half of which is provided equally by two opposite walls (1/80 on each side). The remaining free area can be distributed wherever possible.

c.  Where one element of structure supports, carries or stabilises another, the fire resistance of the supporting element at least matches the minimum period of fire resistance for the other element.

d.  In mixed use buildings, the fire resistance of any element that supports, carries or stabilises an element in the other part of the building should at least match the minimum period of fire resistance for the other element.

e.  All materials used in the construction should be class A1 rated, except for the following.

i. Any surface finish applied to a floor or roof of the car park (or within any building, compartment or separated part adjoining the structure enclosing it), if the finish meets requirements B2 and B4.

ii.  Any fire doorset.

iii.  Any attendant’s kiosk not exceeding 15m2 in area.

iv.  Any shop mobility facility.

Car parks that are not open‑sided

11.3  For car parks that do not have the ventilation set out in paragraph 11.2, the required fire resistance  is given in Appendix B, Table B4. Ventilation should be either natural or mechanical. See Approved Document F for additional guidance on ventilation of car parks.

Natural ventilation

11.4  Each storey should be ventilated by permanent openings at each car parking level. The openings can be at ceiling level. The aggregate free vent area should be a minimum of 1/40 of that level’s floor area, at least half of which should be provided equally by two opposite walls (1/160 on each side). The remaining free area can be distributed wherever possible. Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 89

B3ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONMechanical ventilation

11.5 If the minimum standard of natural ventilation is not possible, a system of mechanical ventilation should be provided that complies with all of the following.

a.  The system should be both of the following.

i. Independent of any other ventilating system (other than any system that provides day to day ventilation to the car park).

ii.  Designed to operate at 10 air changes per hour during a fire.

b.  The system should run in two parts, each of which is:

i. ii. capable of extracting 50% of the rates set out in item (a)

able to operate alone or with the other part

iii.  provided with an independent power supply capable of operating if the main supply fails.

c.  50% of the outlets should be at high level and 50% at low level.

d.  The system should use E, I and S ductwork in accordance with BS EN 1366-8.

For further information on equipment for removing hot smoke, refer to BS EN 12101-3. An alternative method of providing smoke ventilation from enclosed car parks is given in BS 7346-7.

Resisting fire spread over external walls

The external envelope of a building should not contribute to undue fire spread from one part of a building to another part. This intention can be met by constructing external walls so that both of the following are satisfied.

a.  The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building and spread of fire over the outside surface is restricted.

b.  The materials used to construct external walls, and attachments to them, and how they are assembled do not contribute to the rate of fire spread up the outside of the building.

The extent to which this is necessary depends on the height and use of the building. Resisting fire spread from one building to another

The external envelope of a building should not provide a medium for undue fire spread to adjacent buildings or be readily ignited by fires in adjacent buildings. This intention can be met by constructing external walls so that all of the following are satisfied.

a.  The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building is restricted.

b.  The amount of thermal radiation that falls on a neighbouring building from window  openings and other unprotected areas in the building on fire is not enough to start a fire in  the other building.

c.  Flame spread over the roof and/or fire penetration from external sources through the roof  is restricted.

The extent to which this is necessary depends on the use of the building and its position in relation to adjacent buildings and therefore the site boundary.

Introduction

12.1  The external wall of a building should not provide a medium for fire spread if that is likely to be a risk to health and safety. Combustible materials and cavities in external walls and attachments to them can present such a risk, particularly in tall buildings. The guidance in this section is designed to reduce the risk of fire spread as well as the risk of ignition from flames coming from adjacent buildings.

Fire resistance

12.2  This section provides guidance on resisting fire spread over external walls; however, it does not deal with fire resistance of external walls. An external wall may need fire resistance to meet the provisions of Section 2 (Design for horizontal escape), Section 3 (Design for vertical escape),  Section 7 (Loadbearing elements of structure), Section 13 (Resisting fire spread from one building  to another) or Section 17 (Access to buildings for firefighting personnel).

Combustibility of external walls

12.3  The external walls of buildings other than those described in regulation 7(4) of the Building Regulations should achieve either of the following. a.   Follow the provisions given in paragraphs 12.5 to 12.10, which provide guidance on all of  the following.

i. External surfaces.

ii.  Materials and products.

iii.  Cavities and cavity barriers. b.   Meet the performance criteria given in BRE report BR 135 for external walls using full-scale test data from BS 8414-1 or BS 8414-2.

12.4  In relation to buildings of any height or use, consideration should be given to the choice of materials (including their extent and arrangement) used for the external wall, or attachments to the wall (e.g. balconies, etc.), to reduce the risk of fire spread over the wall.

External surfaces

12.5  The external surfaces (i.e. outermost external material) of external walls should comply with the provisions in Table 12.1. The provisions in Table 12.1 apply to each wall individually in relation to its proximity to the relevant boundary. 94  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

This restriction does not apply to masonry cavity wall construction which complies with Diagram 9.2 in Section 9. Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph. 12.7  In buildings that include a ‘residential’ purpose (purpose groups 1 and 2) with a storey 11m or more in height (see Diagram D6 in Appendix D) any insulation product, filler material (such as the core materials of metal composite panels, sandwich panels and window spandrel panels but not including gaskets, sealants and similar) etc. used in the construction of an external wall should be class A2-s1, d0 or better (see Appendix B). This restriction does not apply to masonry cavity wall construction which complies with Diagram 9.2 in Section 9. Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph.

12.8  Best practice guidance for green walls (also called living walls) can be found in Fire Performance of Green Roofs and Walls, published by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph.

Cavities and cavity barriers

12.9  Cavity barriers should be provided in accordance with Section 9. 12.10 In the case of an external wall construction of a building which, by virtue of paragraph 9.10d (external cladding system with a masonry or concrete inner leaf), is not subject to the provisions of Table 9.1, the surfaces which face into cavities should also meet the provisions of Table 12.1 and provisions in Section 9, but where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over the guidance provided in Table 12.1 and Section 9.

Balconies 12.11  In buildings that include a ‘residential’ purpose (purpose groups 1 and 2) with a storey 11m or more in height (see Diagram D6 in Appendix D) balconies should meet either of the following conditions.

a.   Only contain materials achieving class A1 or A2-s1, d0, except for any of the following.

Materials achieving class B-s1, d0 or worse extending beyond the boundary of a single compartment should include a band of material rated class A2-s1, d0 or better, a minimum of 300mm in width centred on that boundary line. Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph.

Metal composite materials 12.12 Regulation 7(1A) prohibits the use of relevant metal composite materials in the external walls, and specified attachments, of all buildings of any height. 12.13 Relevant metal composite materials are defined (in regulation 2(6)(c)) as any panel or sheet, having a thickness of no more than 10mm which is composed of a number of layers two or more of which are made of metal, alloy or metal compound and one or more of which is a substantial layer made of a material having a gross calorific value of more than 35MJ/kg when tested in accordance with BS EN ISO 1716. A substantial layer is defined as a layer which is at least 1mm thick or has a mass per unit area of at least 1kg/m². Regulation 7(2) and requirement B4

Materials 12.14 Regulation 7(1)(a) requires that materials used in building work are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used. Regulation 7(2) sets requirements in respect of external walls and specified attachments in relevant buildings.

NOTE: Further guidance on regulation 7(1) can be found in HM Government’s Manual to the Building Regulations.

12.15 Regulation 7(2) applies to any building with a storey at least 18m above ground level (as measured in accordance with Diagram D6 in Appendix D) and which contains one or more dwellings; an institution; or a room for residential purposes. It requires that all materials which become part of  an external wall or specified attachment achieve class A2-s1, d0 or class A1 in accordance with  BS EN 13501-1, other than those exempted by regulation 7(3).

NOTE: The above includes student accommodation, care homes, sheltered housing, hospitals, dormitories in boarding schools, hotels, hostels and boarding houses. See regulation 7(4) for the definition of relevant buildings.

NOTE: Transposition to a national class (Table B1) does not apply to the classification in this paragraph. 12.16 External walls and specified attachments are defined in regulation 2(6) and these definitions include any parts of the external wall as well as balconies, solar panels and solar shading.

12.17 Regulation 7(3) provides an exemption for certain components found in external walls and specified attachments.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 97

B4ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONMaterial change of use

12.18 Regulations 5(k) and 6(3) provide that, where the use of a building is changed such that the building becomes a building described in regulation 7(4), the construction of the external walls, and specified attachments, must be investigated and, where necessary, work must be carried out to ensure they only contain materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or class A1, other than those exempted by regulation 7(3).

Solar shading devices 12.19 Regulation 7(2) requires that the curtain and or slats of solar shading devices in a relevant building (as defined in regulation 7(4)) achieve class A1 or A2-s1, d0. The curtain of solar shading devices cannot be classified as a membrane in accordance with regulation 7(3). 12.20 Solar shading devices installed up to 4.5m above ground level are not required to meet the requirements of regulation 7(2). Additional considerations

12.21 The provisions of regulation 7 apply in addition to requirement B4. Therefore, for buildings described in regulation 7(4), the potential impact of any products incorporated into or onto the external walls and specified attachments should be carefully considered with regard to their number, size, orientation and position. 12.22 Particular attention is drawn to the following points.

a.    Membranes used as part of the external wall construction above ground level should achieve a minimum of class B-s3, d0. Roofing membranes do not need to achieve a minimum of class A2-s1, d0 when used as part of a roof connecting to an external wall. b.   Internal linings should comply with the guidance provided in Section 4. c.   Any part of a roof should achieve the minimum performance as detailed in Section 12.

d.   As per regulation 7(3), window frames and glass (including laminated glass) are exempted from regulation 7(2). Window spandrel panels and infill panels must comply with regulation 7(2).

e.   Thermal breaks are small elements used as part of the external wall construction to restrict thermal bridging. There is no minimum performance for these materials. However, they should not span two compartments and should be limited in size to the minimum required to restrict the thermal bridging (the principal insulation layer is not to be regarded as a thermal break).

f.    Regulation 7(2) only applies to specified attachments. Shop front signs and similar attachments are not covered by the requirements of regulation 7(2), although attention is drawn to paragraph 12.22g.

g.   While regulation 7(2) applies to materials which become part of an external wall or specified attachment, consideration should be given to other attachments to the wall which could impact on the risk of fire spread over the wall.

h.    Any material achieving class A1fl or A2fl-s1 in accordance with BS EN 13501-1 is exempted when it meets both of the following conditions. i. ii. It forms the top horizontal floor layer of a balcony.

It is provided with an imperforate substrate under it which extends to the full size of the class A1fl or A2fl-s1 material. 98  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

Introduction

13.1  The following assumptions enable a reasonable standard of resistance to the spread of fire to  be specified.

a.  The size of a fire depends on the compartmentation within the building. A fire may involve  a complete compartment, but will not spread to other compartments.

b.  The intensity of fire is related to the building use, but can be moderated by a sprinkler system.

c.  Fires in ‘residential’ and ‘assembly and recreation’ buildings (purposes groups 1, 2 and 5) represent  a greater risk to life.

d.  A building on the far side of the relevant boundary meets both of the following conditions.

i.  Has a similar elevation to the one in question.

ii. Is at the same distance from the common boundary.

e.  The radiated heat passing through any part of the fire resisting external wall may be discounted.

13.2  Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over the provisions within this section.

13.3  If a reduced separation distance between buildings, or increased amount of unprotected area, is required, smaller compartments should be considered.

Boundaries

13.4  The fire resistance of a wall depends on its distance from the relevant boundary (see Diagram 13.1). Separation distances are measured to boundaries to ensure that the location and design of buildings on adjoining sites have no influence on the building under consideration.

13.5  The boundary that a wall faces is the relevant boundary (Diagram 13.2). It may be one of the following. a. The site boundary. b. The centre line of a space where further development is unlikely, such as a road, railway, canal or river. c. An assumed notional boundary between two buildings on the same site (Diagram 13.3) where either of the following conditions is met. i.  One or both of the buildings are in the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose group 1, 2 or 5). ii.  The buildings will be operated/managed by different organisations.

NOTES:

This diagram sets out the rules

that apply in respect of a

boundary for it to be

considered as a relevant

boundary.

For a boundary to be relevant

it should comply with one of

the following:

a. Coincide with the side of

    the building (A).

b. Be parallel to the side of the

    building (B1 or B2).

c. Be at an angle of maximum

    80 degrees to the side

    of the building (C).

See para 13.5

This boundary is at less than

80 degrees to side C and is therefore

relevant to side C

This boundary coincides

with and is therefore

NOTES:

The notional boundary should be set in the area between the two buildings using the following rules:

1.   The notional boundary is assumed to exist in the space between the buildings and is positioned so that one of the buildings would

     comply with the provisions for space separation having regard to the amount of its unprotected area. In practice, if one of the

     buildings is existing, the position of the boundary will be set by the space separation factors for that building.

2.  The siting of the new building, or the second building if both are new, can then be checked to see that it also complies, using the

     notional boundary as the relevant boundary for the second building. Diagram 13.3  Notional boundary

13.6  Parts of an external wall with less fire resistance than the appropriate amount given in Appendix B, Table B4, are called unprotected areas.

13.7  Where a fire resisting external wall has an external surface material that is worse than class B-s3, d2 and is more than 1mm thick, that part of the wall should be classified as an unprotected area equating to half its area (Diagram 13.4).

External walls on, and within 1000mm of, the relevant boundary

13.8  Unprotected areas should meet the conditions in Diagram 13.5 and the rest of the wall should be fire resisting from both sides.

External surface materials facing the boundary should be class B-s3, d2 or better.

External walls 1000mm or more from the relevant boundary

13.9  Unprotected area should not exceed the result given by one of the methods in paragraph 13.17, and the rest of the wall (if any) should be fire resisting but only from the inside of the building. External walls of protected stairways

Roofs

13.15  Roofs with a pitch of more than 70 degrees to the horizontal should be assessed in accordance with this section. Vertical parts of a pitched roof, such as dormer windows, should be included, only if the slope of the roof exceeds 70 degrees. It is a matter of judgement whether a continuous run of dormer windows that occupies most of  a steeply pitched roof should be treated as a wall rather than a roof.

Portal frames

13.16  Portal frames are often used in single storey industrial and commercial buildings where there may be no need for fire resistance of the structure (requirement B3). However, where a portal framed building is near a relevant boundary, the external wall near the boundary may need fire resistance to restrict the spread of fire between buildings. It is generally accepted that a portal frame acts as a single structural element because of the moment-resisting connections used, especially at the column/rafter joints. Thus, in cases where the external wall of the building cannot be wholly unprotected, the rafter members of the frame, as well as the column members, may need to be fire protected. The design method for this is set out in SCI Publication P313.

NOTE: The recommendations in the SCI publication for designing the foundation to resist overturning do not need to be followed if the building is fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.

NOTE: Normally, portal frames of reinforced concrete can support external walls requiring a similar degree of fire resistance without specific provision at the base to resist overturning.

104  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

B4ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONNOTE: Existing buildings may have been designed to comply with all of the following guidance, which is also acceptable.

a.  The column members are fixed rigidly to a base of sufficient size and depth to resist overturning.

b.  There is brick, block or concrete protection to the columns up to a protected ring beam providing lateral support.

c.  There is some form of roof venting to give early heat release. (The roof venting could be, for example, PVC rooflights covering some 10% of the floor area and evenly spaced over the floor area.)

Methods for calculating acceptable unprotected area

13.17  Two simple methods are given for calculating the acceptable amount of unprotected area in an external wall that is a minimum of 1000mm from any point on the relevant boundary. More precise methods are described in BRE report BR 187 and may be used instead. When using BR 187 the following radiation intensity at each unprotected area should be assumed.

a.  84kW/m2 if the purpose group of the building is ‘residential’ (purpose groups 1 or 2), ‘office’ (purpose group 3) or ‘assembly and recreation’ (purpose group 5) or if the building is an open-

sided multi-storey car park (purpose group 7(b)). b.  168kW/m2 if the purpose group of the building is ‘shop and commercial’ (purpose group 4), ‘industrial’ (purpose group 6) or ‘storage and other non-residential’ (purpose group 7(a)).

Method 1

13.18  This method applies to small buildings intended to be used for ‘residential (other)’ purposes.

13.19  The building should not exceed three storeys in height (excluding basements) or 24m in length. Each side of the building should meet the limits stated in Diagram 13.7. Any small unprotected areas falling within the limits shown in Diagram 13.5 can be ignored.

Introduction

14.1 14.2  Provisions for the fire properties of roofs are given in other parts of this document.

‘Roof covering’ describes one or more layers of material, but not the roof structure as a whole. a.  Requirement B1 – for roofs that are part of a means of escape. b.  Requirement B2 – for the internal surfaces of rooflights as part of internal linings.

c.  Requirement B3 – for roofs that are used as a floor and for roofs passing over a compartment wall.

d.  Section 13 – the circumstances in which a roof is subject to the provisions for space separation.

Separation distances

14.3  Separation distance is the minimum distance from the roof, or part of the roof, to the relevant boundary (paragraph 13.5). Table 14.1 sets out separation distances by the type of roof covering and the size and use of the building.

In addition, roof covering products (and/or materials) defined in Commission Decision 2000/553/

EC of 6 September 2000, implementing Council Directive 89/106/EEC, can be considered to fulfil all of the requirements for the performance characteristic ‘external fire performance’ without the need for testing, provided that any national provisions on the design and execution of works are fulfilled, and can be used without restriction.

14.4  The performance of rooflights is specified in a similar way to the performance of roof coverings. Plastic rooflights may also be used.

Plastic rooflights

14.5  Table 14.2 and Diagram 14.1 set the limitations for using plastic rooflights whose lower surface has a minimum rating of class D-s3, d2.

14.6  Table 14.3 sets the limitations for using thermoplastic materials with a TP(a) rigid or TP(b)  (see also Diagram 14.1) classification. The method of classifying thermoplastic materials is given in Appendix B.

14.7  Other than for the purposes of Diagram 8.2, polycarbonate or uPVC rooflights achieving a minimum rating of class C-s3, d2 can be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification.

Unwired glass in rooflights

14.8  When used in rooflights, unwired glass a minimum of 4mm thick can be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification.

Thatch and wood shingles

14.9  If the performance of thatch or wood shingles cannot be established, they should be regarded  as having an EROOF(t4) classification in Table 14.1.

These sections deal with the following requirement from Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.

Requirement

Requirement

Access and facilities for the fire service

B5. (1)   The building shall be designed and constructed so as to provide reasonable facilities to assist fire fighters in the protection of life.

(2)   Reasonable provision shall be made within the site of the building to enable fire appliances to gain access to the building.

Limits on application

Intention

Provisions covering access and facilities for the fire service are to safeguard the health and safety of people in and around the building. Their extent depends on the size and use of the building. Most firefighting is carried out within the building. In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B5 is met by achieving all of the following.

a.  External access enabling fire appliances to be used near the building.

b.  Access into and within the building for firefighting personnel to both:

i. ii. search for and rescue people

fight fire.

c.  Provision for internal fire facilities for firefighters to complete their tasks.

d.  Ventilation of heat and smoke from a fire in a basement.

If an alternative approach is taken to providing the means of escape, outside the scope of this approved document, additional provisions for firefighting access may be required. Where deviating from the general guidance, it is advisable to seek advice from the fire and rescue service as early as possible (even if there is no statutory duty to consult).

15.4  For buildings fitted with dry fire mains, both of the following apply. a.  Access should be provided for a pumping appliance to within 18m of each fire main inlet connection point. Inlets should be on the face of the building.

b.  The fire main inlet connection point should be visible from the parking position of the appliance, and satisfy paragraph 16.10. 15.5  For buildings fitted with wet fire mains, access for a pumping appliance should comply with both of the following. a.  Within 18m, and within sight of, an entrance giving access to the fire main.

b.  Within sight of the inlet to replenish the suction tank for the fire main in an emergency.

15.6  Where fire mains are provided in buildings for which Sections 16 and 17 make no provision, vehicle access may be as described in paragraphs 15.4 and 15.5, rather than Table 15.1.

Design of access routes and hardstandings

15.7  Access routes and hardstandings should comply with the guidance in Table 15.2. Requirements can only apply to the site of the works.

It may not be reasonable to upgrade the route across a site to a small building. The building control body, in consultation with the fire and rescue service, should consider options from doing no work to upgrading certain features, such as sharp bends.

15.8  Where access to an elevation is provided in accordance with Table 15.1, the following requirements should be met, depending on the building height.

a.  Buildings up to 11m, excluding small buildings (paragraph 15.1): pump appliance access should be provided adjacent to the building for the specified percentage of the total perimeter.

b.  Buildings over 11m: access routes should comply with the guidance in Diagram 15.2.

15.9  Where access is provided for high reach appliances in accordance with Table 15.1, overhead obstructions (such as cables and branches) should be avoided in the zone shown in Diagram 15.2.

15.10  Dead-end access routes longer than 20m require turning facilities, as in Diagram 15.3. Turning facilities should comply with the guidance in Table 15.2.

B5ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONB5

Section 18: Venting of heat and smoke from basements

Provision of smoke outlets

18.1  Heat and smoke from basement fires vented via stairs can inhibit access for firefighting personnel. This may be reduced by providing smoke outlets, or smoke vents, which allow heat and smoke to escape from the basement levels to the open air. They can also be used by the fire and rescue service to let cooler air into the basements (Diagram 18.1). 18.2  Each basement space should have one or more smoke outlets.

Where this is not practicable (for example, the plan area is deep and the amount of external wall is restricted by adjoining buildings), the perimeter basement spaces may be vented, with other spaces vented indirectly by opening connecting doors. This does not apply for places of special fire hazard (see paragraph 18.7). If a basement is compartmented, each compartment should have one or more smoke outlets, rather than indirect venting.

A basement storey or compartment containing rooms with doors or windows does not need smoke outlets.

18.3  Smoke outlets connecting directly to the open air should be provided from every basement storey, except for any basement storey that has both of the following.

a.  A maximum floor area of 200m2.

b.  A floor a maximum of 3m below the adjacent ground level.

18.4  Strong rooms do not need to be provided with smoke outlets.

Natural smoke outlets

18.5  Smoke outlets should be both of the following.

a.  Sited at high level in either the ceiling or wall of the space they serve.

b.  Evenly distributed around the perimeter, to discharge to the open air.

18.6  The combined clear cross-sectional area of all smoke outlets should be a minimum of 1/40 of the area of the floor of the storey they serve.

18.7  Separate outlets should be provided from places of special fire hazard.

18.8  If the smoke outlet terminates at a point that is not readily accessible, it should be kept unobstructed and covered only with a class A1 grille or louvre.

18.9  If the smoke outlet terminates in a readily accessible position, it may be covered by a panel, stallboard or pavement light that can be broken out or opened. The position of covered smoke outlets should be suitably indicated.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 123

ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION18.10 Outlets should not be placed where they prevent the use of escape routes from the building.

Mechanical smoke extract

18.11  If basement storeys are fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E, a mechanical smoke extraction system may be provided as an alternative to natural venting. Sprinklers do not need to be installed on the other storeys unless needed for other reasons.

Car parks are not normally expected to be fitted with sprinklers (see Section 11 for guidance on  car parks).

18.12  The air extraction system should comply with all of the following.

a. It should give at least 10 air changes per hour.

b. It should be capable of handling gas temperatures of 300°C for not less than one hour.

c. It should do either of the following.

i. Be activated automatically if the sprinkler system activates.

ii.  Be activated by an automatic fire detection system that conforms to BS 5839-1  (minimum L3 standard). Further information on equipment for removing hot smoke is given in BS EN 12101-3.

Construction of outlet ducts or shafts

18.13  Outlet ducts or shafts, including any bulkheads over them (see Diagram 18.1), should be enclosed in construction of class A1 rating and fire resistance at least equal to that of the element through which they pass. 18.14  Natural smoke outlet shafts should be separated from each other using construction of class A1 rating and fire resistance at least equal to that of the storeys they serve, where the shafts are either of the following.

a.  From different compartments of the same basement storey.

b.  From different basement storeys.

Basement car parks

Appendix B: Performance of materials, products and structures

Introduction

B1  Much of the guidance in this document is given in terms of performance classifications in relation to British or European Standards. In such cases, it will be necessary to demonstrate that a system or product can meet the relevant performance classification. This will be achieved if the system or product complies with one of the following.

a.  They should be in accordance with a specification or design that has been shown by a specific test to be capable of meeting that performance classification.

b.  They should have been designed by using relevant design standards in order to meet that performance classification.

c.  They should have been assessed by applying relevant test evidence, in lieu of carrying out a specific test, as being capable of meeting that performance classification.

NOTE: Some products are subject to Classification Without Further Testing (CWFT). For the purposes of this approved document, such products can be considered to have been shown to be capable of meeting a performance specification as per paragraph B1a. B2  Any test evidence used to demonstrate the fire performance classification of a product or system should be carefully checked to ensure that it is applicable to the intended use. Small differences in detail, such as fixing method, joints, dimensions, the introduction of insulation materials and air gaps (ventilated or not), can significantly affect the performance.

B3  Assessments should not be regarded as a way to avoid a test where one is necessary. Assessments should only be carried out where sufficient relevant test evidence is available. Relevant test evidence is unlikely to be provided by test standards which have different classification criteria.

B4  Where it is proposed to assess the classification of a product or system in lieu of carrying out a specific test (as in paragraph B1c), this should be done in accordance with the relevant standard for extended application for the test in question and should include details of the test evidence that has been used to support the assessment. For performance classifications where there is no specific standard for extended application, assessment reports should be produced in accordance with the principles of BS EN 15725 and should include details of the test evidence that has been used to support the assessment. Further information on best practice is provided in the Passive Fire Protection Forum’s Guide to Undertaking Technical Assessments of the Fire Performance of Construction Products Based on Fire Test Evidence.

NOTE: Regulation 7(2) limits components used in or on the external walls of certain buildings to materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or class A1 (see Section 12). Assessments cannot be used to demonstrate compliance with this requirement. B5  Tests and assessments should be carried out by organisations with the necessary expertise. For example, organisations listed as ‘notified bodies’ in accordance with the European Construction 136  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010

ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONB

B

B

Products Regulation or laboratories accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) for the relevant test standard can be assumed to have the necessary expertise. NOTE: Standard fire tests do not directly measure fire hazard. They measure or assess the response of a material or system to exposure to one or more aspects of fire conditions. Performance in fire tests is only one of a number of factors that should be taken into account.

Reaction to fire

B6  Reaction to fire relates to the degree to which a product will contribute, by its own decomposition, to a fire under specified conditions. Products, other than floorings, are classified as A1, A2, B, C, D, E or F (with class A1 being the highest performance and F being the lowest) in accordance with BS EN 13501-1. Class F is assigned when a product fails to attain class E. Untested products cannot be classified in accordance with BS EN 13501-1. Materials covered by the Classification Without Further Testing (CWFT) process can be found by accessing the European Commission’s website https://eur-lex.europa.eu/.

B7  The classes of reaction to fire performance of A2, B, C, D and E are accompanied by additional classifications related to the production of smoke (s1, s2, s3), with s1 indicating the lowest production, and/or flaming droplets/particles (d0, d1, d2), with d0 indicating the lowest production. NOTE:  When a classification includes s3, d2 this means that there is no limit set for smoke production and/or flaming droplets/particles.

B8  To reduce the testing burden on manufacturers, BS EN 13238 defines a number of standard substrates that produce test results representative of different end use applications. The classification for reaction to fire achieved during testing is only valid when the product is used within this field of application, i.e. when the product is fixed to a substrate of that class in its end use. The standard substrate selected for testing should take account of the intended end use applications (field of application) of the product and represent end use substrates that have a density of a minimum of 75% of the standard substrate’s nominal density. B9  Standard substrates include gypsum plasterboard (BS EN 520) with a density of 700+/-100kg/m3, calcium silicate board (BS EN 14306) 870+/-50kg/m3 and fibre-cement board 1800+/-200kg/m3.

NOTE: Standard calcium silicate board is not representative of gypsum plasterboard end use (due to the paper layer), but would be representative of most gypsum plasters (with densities of more than 650kg/m3). NOTE: Classifications based on tests using a plasterboard substrate would also be acceptable for products bonded to a gypsum plaster end use substrate.

National classifications for reaction to fire

B10  This document uses the European classification system for reaction to fire set out in BS EN 13501-1;  however, there may be some products lawfully on the market using the classification system set out in previous editions. Where this is the case, Table B1 can be used for the purposes of this document.

i.  does not flame

ii. causes a rise in temperature on the furnace thermocouple not exceeding 20°C

b.  Any material of density less than 300kg/m3, which, when tested to BS 476-11, complies with both of the following:

i.  does not flame for more than 10 seconds

ii.  causes a rise in temperature on the thermocouple at the centre of the specimen or in the furnace that is a maximum of 35°C and on the furnace thermocouple that is a maximum of 25°C

Any material that meets both of the following criteria.

a.  Class 1 in accordance with BS 476-7.

b.  Has a fire propagation index (I) of a maximum of 12 and sub-index (i1) of a maximum of 6, determined by using the method given in BS 476-6. Index of performance (I) relates to the overall test performance, whereas sub-index (i1) is derived from the first three minutes of the test

Class 1 in accordance with BS 476-7

Class 3 in accordance with BS 476-7

NOTE: The national classifications do not automatically equate with the transposed classifications in the ‘BS EN 13501-1 classification’ column, therefore products cannot typically assume a European class unless they have been tested accordingly.

NOTE: A classification of s3, d2 indicates that no limit is set for production of smoke and/or flaming droplets/particles. If a performance for production of smoke and/or flaming droplets/

particles is specified, then only the European classes can be used. For example, a national class may not be used as an alternative to a classification which includes s1, d0. Thermoplastic materials

B11  Thermoplastic material is any synthetic polymeric material that has a softening point below 200°C if tested to BS EN ISO 306 Method A120. Products formed from these materials cannot always be classified in the normal way. In those circumstances the following approach can be followed. B12  Thermoplastic materials used for window glazing, rooflights and lighting diffusers within suspended ceilings do not need to meet the criteria within paragraph B19 onwards, if the guidance to requirements B2 and B4 is followed.

B13  For the purposes of requirements B2 and B4, thermoplastic materials should be classified as TP(a) rigid, TP(a) flexible or TP(b), as follows:

a.  TP(a) rigid

i. rigid solid uPVC sheet

ii.  solid (as distinct from double- or multi-skinned) polycarbonate sheet a minimum of 3mm thick

iii.  multi-skinned rigid sheet made from uPVC or polycarbonate that has a class 1 rating when tested to BS 476-7

iv.  any other rigid thermoplastic product, a specimen of which (at the thickness of the product as put on the market), when tested to BS 2782-0 Method 508A, performs so that both: • • the test flame extinguishes before the first mark the duration of flaming or afterglow does not exceed 5 seconds following removal of the burner.

b.  TP(a) flexible

Flexible products a maximum of 1mm thick that comply with the Type C requirements of  BS 5867-2 when tested to BS 5438 Test 2 with the flame applied to the surface of the specimens for 5, 15, 20 and 30 seconds respectively, but excluding the cleansing procedure; and

c.  TP(b)

i. rigid solid polycarbonate sheet products a maximum of 3mm thick, or multi-skinned polycarbonate sheet products that do not qualify as TP(a) by test

ii.  other products which, when a specimen of the material between 1.5 and 3mm thick is tested in accordance with BS 2782-0 Method 508A, have a maximum rate of burning of 50mm/minute.

NOTE: If it is not possible to cut or machine a 3mm thick specimen from the product, then a 3mm test specimen can be moulded from the same material as that used to manufacture the product.

B14  A thermoplastic material alone when used as a lining to a wall or ceiling cannot be assumed to protect a substrate. The surface rating of both thermoplastic material and substrate must therefore meet the required classification. If, however, the thermoplastic material is fully bonded to a non-thermoplastic substrate, then only the surface rating of the composite needs to meet the required classification.

Roofs

B15  Performance of the resistance of roofs to external fire exposure is measured in terms of penetration through the roof construction and the spread of flame over its surface.

B16  Roof constructions are classified within the European system as BROOF(t4), CROOF(t4), DROOF(t4), EROOF(t4) or FROOF(t4) in accordance with BS EN 13501-5. BROOF(t4) indicates the highest performance and FROOF(t4) the lowest.

B17  BS EN 13501-5 refers to four separate roof tests. The suffix (t4) used in paragraph B16 indicates that Test 4 is to be used for the purposes of this approved document.

NOTE: The national classifications do not automatically equate with the transposed classifications in the European column, therefore products cannot typically assume a European class unless they have been tested accordingly.

Fire resistance

B19  Common to all of the provisions of Part B of the Building Regulations is the property of fire resistance. Fire resistance is a measure of one or more of the following.

a.  Resistance to collapse (loadbearing capacity), which applies to loadbearing elements only, denoted R in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance.

b.  Resistance to fire penetration (integrity), denoted E in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance.

c.  Resistance to the transfer of excessive heat (insulation), denoted I in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance.

B20  The standards of fire resistance necessary for a particular building are based on assumptions about the severity of fires and the consequences should an element fail. Fire severity is estimated in very broad terms from the use of the building (its purpose group), on the assumption that the building contents (which constitute the fire load) are similar for buildings with the same use.

B21  Because the use of buildings may change, a precise estimate of fire severity based on the fire load due to a particular use may be misleading. Therefore if a fire engineering approach of this kind is adopted, the likelihood that the fire load may change in the future needs to be considered.

B22  Performance in terms of the fire resistance to be achieved by elements of structure, doors and other forms of construction is classified in accordance with one of the following.

a.  BS EN 13501-2.

b.  BS EN 13501-3.

c.  BS EN 13501-4.

BS EN 13501-3 Classification using data from fire resistance tests on products and elements used in building service installations: fire resisting ducts and fire dampers. BS EN 13501-4 Classification using data from fire resistance tests on components of smoke control systems.

In the European classification: ‘R’ is the resistance to fire in terms of loadbearing capacity. ‘E’ is the resistance to fire in terms of integrity.

‘I’ is the resistance to fire in terms of insulation.

The national classifications do not automatically equate with the alternative classifications in the European column, therefore products cannot typically assume a European class unless they have been tested accordingly.

2. BS 476-20 for general principles, BS 476-21 for loadbearing elements, BS 476-22 for non-loadbearing elements,  BS 476-23 for fire-protecting suspended ceilings and BS 476-24 for ventilation ducts. 3. Applies to loadbearing elements only (see paragraph B19).

4. Guidance on increasing the fire resistance of existing timber floors is given in BRE Digest 208.

5. Only if a suspended ceiling meets the appropriate provisions should it be relied on to add to the fire resistance of the floor.

6. Such walls may contain areas that do not need to be fire resisting (unprotected areas). See Section 13.

NOTES:

For single storey buildings, the periods under the heading ‘Up to 5’ apply. If single storey buildings have basements, for the basement storeys the period appropriate to their depth applies.

*  For the floor over a basement or, if there is more than one basement, the floor over the topmost basement, the higher of the period for the basement storey and the period for the ground or upper storey applies.

†  For compartment walls that separate buildings, the period is increased to a minimum of 60 minutes.

+  For any floor that does not contribute to the support of the building within a flat of more than one storey, the period is reduced to 30 minutes. §  For flat conversions, refer to paragraphs 6.5 to 6.7 of Approved Document B Volume 1 regarding the acceptability of 30 minutes.  ‡  For elements that do not form part of the structural frame, the period is reduced to 90 minutes.

#  For elements that protect the means of escape, the period is increased to 30 minutes.

1.  Refer to note 1, Table B3 for the specific provisions of test.

2. Blocks of flats with a top storey more than 11m above ground level (see Diagram D6) should be fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.

NOTE: Sprinklers should be provided within the individual flats, they do not need to be provided in the common areas such as stairs, corridors or landings when these areas are fire sterile. 3. ‘With sprinkler system’ means that the building is fitted throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.

4. Very large (with a top storey more than 18m above ground level or with a 10m deep basement) or unusual dwellinghouses are outside the scope of the guidance provided with regard to dwellinghouses. 5. A minimum of 30 minutes in the case of three storey dwellinghouses, increased to 60 minutes minimum for compartment walls separating buildings.

6. Buildings within the ‘office’, ‘shop and commercial’, ‘assembly and recreation’, ‘industrial’ and ‘storage and other non-residential’ (except car parks for light vehicles) purpose groups (purpose groups 3 to 7(a)) require sprinklers where there is a top storey more than 30m above ground level. 7. The car park should comply with the relevant provisions in the guidance on requirement B3, Section 11.

8. For the purposes of meeting the Building Regulations, the following types of steel elements are deemed to have satisfied the minimum period of fire resistance of 15 minutes when tested to the European test method.

i.  Beams supporting concrete floors, maximum Hp/A=230m-1 operating under full design load.

ii.  Free-standing columns, maximum Hp/A=180m-1 operating under full design load.

iii. Wind bracing and struts, maximum Hp/A=210m-1 operating under full design load.

B

Application of the fire resistance standards in Table B4

B26  The following guidance should be used when applying the fire resistance standards in Table B4.

a. If one element of structure supports or carries or gives stability to another, the fire resistance of the supporting element should be no less than the minimum period of fire resistance for the other element (whether that other element is loadbearing or not). In some circumstances, it may be reasonable to vary this principle, for example:

i. ii. if the supporting structure is in the open air and is not likely to be affected by the fire in the building

if the supporting structure is in a different compartment, with a fire-separating element (that has the higher standard of fire resistance) between the supporting and the separated structure

iii. if a plant room on the roof needs greater fire resistance than the elements of structure that support it.

If an element of structure forms part of more than one building or compartment, that element should be constructed to the standard of the higher of the relevant provisions.

If, due to the slope of the ground, one side of a basement is open at ground level (allowing smoke to vent and providing access for firefighting) for elements of structure in that storey it may be appropriate to adopt the standard of fire resistance that applies to above-ground structures.

b. c. d.  Although most elements of structure in a single storey building may not need fire resistance, fire resistance is needed if one of the following applies to the element.

i. ii. It is part of, or supports, an external wall, and there is provision in the guidance on requirement B4 to limit the extent of openings and other unprotected areas in the wall.

It is part of, or supports, a compartment wall, including a wall that is common to two or more buildings.

iii. It supports a gallery.

B27  For the purposes of this paragraph, the ground storey of a building that has one or more basement storeys and no upper storeys may be considered as a single storey building. The fire resistance of the basement storeys should be that specified for basements.

Appendix C: Fire doorsets

C1  All fire doorsets should have the performance shown in Table C1, based on one of the following.

a.  Fire resistance in terms of integrity, for a period of minutes, when tested to BS 476-22, e.g. FD 30.  A suffix (S) is added for doorsets where restricted smoke leakage at ambient temperatures is needed.

b.  As determined with reference to Commission Decision 2000/367/EC regarding the classification of the resistance to fire performance of construction products, construction works and parts thereof. All fire doorsets should be classified in accordance with BS EN 13501-2, tested to the relevant European method from the following.

i. BS EN 1634-1.

ii.  BS EN 1634-2.

iii.  BS EN 1634-3.

c.  As determined with reference to European Parliament and Council Directive 95/16/EC (which applies to lifts that permanently serve buildings and constructions and specified safety components) on the approximation of laws of Member States relating to lifts (‘Lifts Directive’) implementing the Lifts Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/831) and calling upon the harmonised standard BS EN 81-58.

C2  The performance requirement is in terms of integrity (E) for a period of minutes. An additional classification of Sa is used for all doors where restricted smoke leakage at ambient temperatures is needed.

C3  The requirement is for test exposure from each side of the doorset separately. The exception is lift doors, which are tested from the landing side only.

C4  Any test evidence used to verify the fire resistance rating of a doorset or shutter should be checked to ensure both of the following.

a. It adequately demonstrates compliance.

b. It is applicable to the complete installed assembly. Small differences in detail may significantly affect the rating.

Until relevant harmonised product standards are published, for the purposes of meeting the Building Regulations, products tested in accordance with BS EN 1634-1 (with or without pre-fire test mechanical conditioning) that achieve the minimum performance in Table C1 will be deemed to satisfy the provisions.

C5  All fire doorsets, including to flat entrances and between a dwellinghouse and an integral garage, should be fitted with a self-closing device, except for all of the following.

a.  Fire doorsets to cupboards.

b.  Fire doorsets to service ducts normally locked shut.

c.  Fire doorsets within flats and dwellinghouses.

C6 If a self-closing device would be considered to interfere with the normal approved use of the building, self-closing fire doors may be held open by one of the following.

Building Regulations 2010  Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 151

ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONC

C

a.  A fusible link, but not if the doorset is in an opening provided as a means of escape unless it complies with paragraph C7.

b.  An automatic release mechanism activated by an automatic fire detection and alarm system.

c.  A door closer delay device.

C7  Two fire doorsets may be fitted in the same opening if each door is capable of closing the opening, so the total fire resistance is the sum of their individual resistances. If the opening is provided as a means of escape, both fire doorsets should be self-closing.

If one fire doorset is capable of being easily opened by hand and has a minimum of 30 minutes’ fire resistance, the other fire doorset should comply with both of the following.

a.  Be fitted with an automatic self-closing device.

b.  Be held open by a fusible link.

C8  Fire doorsets often do not provide any significant insulation. Unless providing both integrity and insulation in accordance with Appendix B, Table B3, a maximum of 25% of the length of a compartment wall should consist of door openings.

Where it is practicable to maintain a clear space on both sides of the doorway, the above percentage may be greater.

C9  Rolling shutters should be capable of manual opening and closing for firefighting purposes (see Section 17). Rolling shutters across a means of escape should only be released by a heat sensor, such as a fusible link or electric heat detector, in the immediate vicinity of the door. Unless a shutter is also intended to partially descend as part of a boundary to a smoke reservoir, shutters across a means of escape should not be closed by smoke detectors or a fire alarm system.

C10  Unless shown to be satisfactory when tested as part of a fire doorset assembly, the essential components of any hinge on which a fire door is hung should be made entirely from materials that have a minimum melting point of 800°C.

C11  Except for doorsets listed in paragraph C12, all fire doorsets should be marked with one of the following fire safety signs, complying with BS 5499-5, as appropriate.

a.  To be kept closed when not in use – mark ‘Fire door keep shut’.

b.  To be kept locked when not in use – mark ‘Fire door keep locked shut’.

c.  Held open by an automatic release mechanism or free swing device – mark ‘Automatic fire door keep clear’.

All fire doorsets should be marked on both sides, except fire doorsets to cupboards and service ducts, which should be marked on the outside.

C12  The following fire doorsets are not required to comply with paragraph C11.

a.  Doors to and within flats and dwellinghouses.

b.  Bedroom doors in ‘residential (other)’ (purpose group 2(b)) premises.

c.  Lift entrance/landing doors.

C13  The performance of some doorsets set out in Table C1 is linked to the minimum periods of fire resistance for elements of structure given in Tables B3 and B4. Limitations on the use of uninsulated glazing in fire doorsets are given in Table B5.

NOTES:

1.  As an alternative to using the values in the table, the floor space factor may be determined by reference to actual data taken from similar premises. Where appropriate, the data should reflect the average occupant density at a peak trading time of year.

2.  Where accommodation is not directly covered by the descriptions given, a reasonable value based on a similar use may be selected.

3.  Where any part of the building is to be used for more than one type of accommodation, the most onerous factor(s) should be applied. Where the building contains different types of accommodation, the occupancy of each different area should be calculated using the relevant space factor.

4.  For detailed guidance on appropriate floor space factors for concourses in sports grounds refer to Concourses published by the Football Licensing Authority.

5.   Alternatively the occupant number may be taken as the number of fixed seats provided, if the occupants will normally be seated.

6.  Shops excluding those under item 10, but including: supermarkets and department stores (main sales areas), shops for personal services, such as hairdressing, and shops for the delivery or collection of goods for cleaning, repair or other treatment or for members of the public themselves carrying out such cleaning, repair or other treatment.

7.   Shops (excluding those in covered shopping complexes but including department stores) trading predominantly in furniture, floor coverings, cycles, prams, large domestic appliances or other bulky goods, or trading on a wholesale self-selection basis (cash and carry).

Travel distance

D3  Travel distance is measured as the shortest route. Both of the following should be observed.

a. If there is fixed seating or other fixed obstructions, the shortest route is along the centre line of the seatways and gangways. b. If the route includes a stair, the shortest route is along the pitch line on the centre line of travel.

Width

D4  Width is measured according to the following.

a.  For a door (or doorway), the clear width when the door is open (Diagram D1).

b.  For an escape route, either of the following.

i.  When the route is defined by walls: the width at 1500mm above finished floor level.

ii. Elsewhere: the minimum width of passage available between any fixed obstructions.

c.  For a stair, the clear width between the walls or balustrades. On escape routes and stairs, handrails and strings intruding into the width by a maximum of 100mm on each side may be ignored. Rails used for guiding a stair-lift may be ignored, but it should be possible to park the lift’s chair or carriage in a position that does not obstruct the stair or landing.

Design of sprinkler systems E3  Where required, sprinkler systems should be provided throughout the building or separated part, unless acting as a compensatory feature to address a specific risk. They should be designed and installed in accordance with the following.

a.  For residential buildings, the requirements of BS 9251. b.  For non-residential buildings, or residential buildings outside the scope of BS 9251, the requirements of BS EN 12845, including the relevant hazard classification together with additional measures to improve system reliability and availability as described in Annex F of the standard.

NOTE: Any sprinkler system installed to satisfy the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations should be provided with additional measures to improve system reliability and availability and is therefore to be regarded as a life safety system. However, there may be some circumstances in which additional measures to improve system reliability and availability specified in Annex F of BS EN 12845 are inappropriate or unnecessary.

If the provisions in a building vary from those in this document, sprinkler protection can also sometimes be used as a compensatory feature.

E4 BS 9251 makes additional recommendations when sprinklers are proposed as compensatory features.

Water supplies and pumps

E5  For non-residential sprinkler systems designed and installed to BS EN 12845, water supplies should consist of either of the following.

a.  Two single water supplies complying with clause 9.6.1, independent of each other.

b.  Two stored water supplies meeting all of the following conditions.

i.  Gravity or suction tanks should satisfy all the requirements of clause 9.6.2(b), other than capacity.

ii.  Any pump arrangements should comply with clause 10.2.

iii. In addition to meeting the requirements for inflow, either of the following should apply.

•  The capacity of each tank should be at least half the specified minimum water volume of a single full capacity tank, appropriate to the hazard.

•  One tank should be at least equivalent to half the specified water volume of a single full capacity tank, and the other shall not be less than the minimum volume of a reduced capacity tank (see clause 9.3.4) appropriate to the hazard.

The total capacity of the water supply in (iii), including any inflow for a reduced capacity tank, should be at least that of a single full holding capacity tank that complies with Table 9, Table 10 or clause 9.3.2.3, as appropriate to the hazard and pipework design.

E6  For the systems described in paragraph E5, both of the following apply if pumps are used to draw water from two tanks.

a.  Each pump should be able to draw water from either tank.

b.  Any one pump, or either tank, should be able to be isolated.

The sprinkler water supplies should not be used as connections for other services or other fixed firefighting systems.
