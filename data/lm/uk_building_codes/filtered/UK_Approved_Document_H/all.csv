237_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,H1
238_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,This section gives guidance on the 2.1 construction of underground drains and sewers from buildings to the point of connection to an existing sewer or a cesspool or wastewater treatment system and includes any drains or sewers outside the curtilage of the building.
239_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Disused and defective pipework is known to harbour rats (see Appendix H1-B).
240_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Some public sewers may carry foul water 2.2 and rainwater in the same pipes.
241_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"If the drainage system is also to carry rainwater to such a sewer, the following provisions still apply but the pipe sizes may need to be increased to carry the combined flows (see paragraph 2.35)."
242_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"In some circumstances, separate drainage should still be provided (see Approved Document H5)."
243_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Outlets
244_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Foul drainage should be connected to a 2.3 public foul or combined sewer wherever this is reasonably practicable.
245_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,For small developments connection should be made to a public sewer where this is within 30m provided that the developer has the right to construct the drainage over any intervening private land.
246_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Where levels do not permit drainage by gravity a pumping installation should be provided (see paragraphs 2.36 to 2.39).
247_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,For larger developments it may be economic 2.4 to connect to a public sewer even where the sewer is some distance away.
248_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"For developments comprising more than one curtilage, the developer may requisition a sewer from the sewerage undertaker who has powers to construct sewers over private land (see Appendix H1-C, C.4)."
249_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The sewerage undertaker should be 2.5 notified at least three weeks before it is intended to connect to the public sewer (see Appendix H1-C, C.7)."
250_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where it is not reasonably practicable to connect to a public sewer, it may be possible to connect to an existing private sewer that connects with a public sewer."
251_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The permission of the owner or owners of the sewer will be required.
252_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The sewer should be in satisfactory condition and have sufficient capacity to take the additional flows.
253_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where none of these options is reasonably practicable, a wastewater treatment system or cesspool should be provided (see Approved Document H2)."
254_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Surcharging of drains
255_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Combined and rainwater sewers are designed to surcharge (i.e. the water level in the manhole rises above the top of the pipe) in heavy rainfall.
256_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Some foul sewers also receive rainwater and therefore surcharge.
257_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,For low-lying sites (where the ground level of the site or the level of a basement is below the ground level at the point where the drainage connects to the public sewer) care should be taken to ensure that the property is not at increased risk of flooding.
258_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,In all such cases the sewerage undertaker should be consulted to determine the extent and possible frequency of the likely surcharge.
259_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"For basements containing sanitary 2.9 appliances, where the risk of flooding due to surcharge of the sewer is considered by the sewerage undertaker to be high, the drainage from the basement should be pumped (see paragraphs 2.36 to 2.39)."
260_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Where the risk is considered to be low an anti-flooding valve should be installed on the drainage from the basement.
261_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"For other low-lying sites (i.e. not basements) where risk is considered low, sufficient protection for the building may be possible by provision of a gully outside the building at least 75mm below the floor level."
262_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,This should be positioned so that any flooding from the gully will not damage any buildings.
263_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"In higher risk areas an anti-flooding valve should be provided, or the drainage system pumped (see paragraph 2.36 to 2.39)."
264_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Anti
265_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"-flooding valves should preferably be of the double valve type, and should be suitable for foul water and have a manual closure device."
266_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,They should comply with the requirements of prEN 13564.
267_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A single valve should not normally serve more than one building.
268_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A notice should be provided inside the building to indicate that the system is drained through such a valve.
269_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"This notice should also indicate the location of any manual override, and include advice on necessary maintenance."
270_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,All drainage unaffected by surcharge should by-pass the protective measures and discharge by gravity.
271_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Layout
272_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The layout of the drainage system should be kept simple.
273_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Changes of direction and gradient should be minimised and as easy as practicable.
274_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Access points should be provided only if blockages could not be cleared without them.
275_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Connection of drains to other drains or private or public sewers, and of private sewers to public sewers, should be made obliquely, or in the direction of flow."
276_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Connections should be made using prefabricated components.
277_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Where holes are cut in pipes a drilling device should be used to avoid damaging the pipe.
278_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where connections made to existing drains or sewers involve removal of pipes and insertion of a junction, repair couplings should be used to ensure a watertight joint and the junction should be carefully packed to avoid differential settlement with adjacent pipes."

281_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Sewers (serving more than one property) should be kept as far as is practicable away from the point on a building where a future extension is likely (e.g. rear of a house, or side of house where there is room for a side extension)."
282_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The system should be ventilated by a flow of air.
283_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A ventilating pipe should be provided at or near the head of each main drain.
284_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"An open ventilating pipe (without an air admittance valve) should be provided on any drain fitted with an intercepting trap (particularly on a sealed system), and on any drain subject to surcharge."
285_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Ventilated discharge stacks may be used (see paragraphs 1.27 and 1.29).
286_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Ventilating pipes should not finish near openings in buildings (see paragraph 1.31).
287_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Pipes should be laid to even gradients and any change of gradient should be combined with an access point (see paragraph 2.49).
288_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Pipes should also be laid in straight lines where practicable but may be laid to slight curves if these can still be cleared of blockages.
289_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Any bends should be limited to positions in or close to inspection chambers or manholes (see paragraph 2.49) and to the foot of discharge and ventilating stacks.
290_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Bends should have as large a radius as practicable.
291_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drainage serving kitchens in commercial hot food premises should be fitted with a grease separator complying with BS EN 1825-1:2004 and designed in accordance with BS EN 1825-2:2002 or other effective means of grease removal.
292_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Special protection – rodent control
293_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Where the site has been previously developed the local authority should be consulted to determine whether any special measures are necessary for control of rodents.
294_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Special measures which may be taken include the following.
295_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Sealed drainage – drainage having access covers to the pipework in the inspection chamber instead of an open channel.
296_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"These should only be used in inspection chambers, where maintenance can be carried out from the surface without personnel entry."
297_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Intercepting traps – These are susceptible to blockage and require frequent maintenance.
298_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Intercepting trap stoppers should be of the locking type that can be easily removed from the chamber surface and securely replaced after blockage clearance.
299_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,It is important that stoppers are replaced after maintenance.
300_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,These should only be used in inspection chambers where maintenance can be carried out from the surface without personnel entry.
301_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Rodent barriers – a number of rodent barrier devices are used in other countries; these include: enlarged sections on discharge stacks to prevent rats climbing, flexible downward facing fins in the discharge stack, or one way valves in underground drainage."
302_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Metal cages on ventilator stack terminals should also be used to discourage rats from leaving the drainage system (see paragraph 1.31).
303_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Covers and gratings to gullies may be displaced or attacked by rats.
304_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Solid plastic covers or metal gratings which can be fixed in place should be used to discourage rats from leaving the system.
305_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Protection from settlement
306_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A drain may run under a building if at least 100mm of granular or other flexible filling is provided round the pipe.
307_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"On sites where excessive subsidence is possible additional flexible joints may be advisable or other solutions such as suspended drainage, particularly where the pipe is adjacent to structures or where soil conditions change in the course of the pipe run."
308_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where the crown of the pipe is within 300mm of the underside of the slab, special protection should be provided (see paragraph 2.44)."
309_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"At any points where pipes are built into a structure, including an inspection chamber, manhole, footing, ground beam or wall, suitable measures should be taken to prevent damage or misalignment."
310_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,This may be achieved by either:
311_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,building in a length of pipe (as short as possible) with its joints as close as possible to the wall faces (within at most 150mm) and connected on each side of rocker pipes by a length of at most 600mm and flexible joints (see Diagram 7(a)); or
312_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,forming an opening to give at least 50mm clearance all round the pipe and the opening masked with rigid sheet material to prevent ingress of fill or vermin.
313_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,It is important that the void is also filled with a compressible sealant to prevent ingress of gas (see Diagram 7(b)).
314_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A drain trench should not be excavated lower than the foundations of any building nearby (see Diagram 8) unless either:
315_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,where the trench is within 1m of the foundation the trench is filled with concrete up to the lowest level of the foundation; or
316_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"where the trench is further than 1m from the building, the trench is filled with concrete to a level below the lowest level for the building equal to the distance from the building, less 150mm."

322_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The local authority may be able to provide information regarding the site.
323_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Depth of pipe cover
324_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The depth of cover will usually depend on the levels of the connections to the system, the gradients at which the pipes should be laid and the ground levels."
325_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Pipes also need to be protected from damage and if the limits of cover are not attainable it may be possible to choose another pipe strength and pipe bedding class combination (Guidance is given in BS EN 1295-1 National Annex NA).
326_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Alternatively special protection can be provided (see paragraphs 2.41 to 2.45).
327_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Pipe gradients and sizes
328_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drains should have enough capacity to carry the flow.
329_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The flow depends on the appliances connected (see paragraphs 0.1–0.3 and Table 5) and the capacity depends on the size and gradient of the pipes (see Diagram 9).

348_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A drain carrying foul water should have an internal diameter of at least 75mm.
349_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A drain carrying effluent from a WC or trade effluent should have an internal diameter of at least 100mm.
350_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Table 6 shows the flattest gradients at which drains should be laid (depending on the flow and the appliances connected to them) and the capacity they will then have (see also paragraphs 0.1–0.3).
351_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Combined systems – the capacity of systems carrying foul water and rainwater should take account of the combined peak flow (see Approved Document H3 Rainwater drainage paragraph 3.8).
352_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Pumping installations
353_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where gravity drainage is impracticable, or protection against flooding due to surcharge in downstream sewers is required, a pumping installation will be needed."

355_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Floor mounted units may be particularly suited for installation in basements.
356_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,These should conform to BS EN 12050.
357_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Pumping installations for use inside buildings should be designed in accordance with BS EN 12056-4.

360_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where foul water drainage from a building is to be pumped, the effluent receiving chamber should be sized to contain 24-hour inflow to allow for disruption in service."
361_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The minimum daily discharge of foul drainage should be taken as 150 litres per head per day for domestic use.
362_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"For other types of building, the capacity of the receiving chamber should be based on the calculated daily demand of the water intake for the building."
363_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where only a proportion of the foul sewage is to be pumped, then the capacity should be based pro-rata."

664_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,This should be done in a manner which does not damage any pipe which is still in use and ensures that the sewer system is water tight.
665_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"This may be carried out, for example, by removing the pipe from a junction and placing a stopper in the branch of the junction fitting."
666_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Where the connection was to a public sewer the sewerage undertaker should be consulted.
667_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drains or sewers less than 1.5m deep which are in open ground should as far as is practicable be removed.
668_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Other pipes should be sealed at both ends and at any point of connection, and grout filled to ensure that rats cannot gain access."
669_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Larger pipes (225mm and above) should be grout filled to prevent subsidence or damage to buildings or services in the event of collapse.

672_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,H1
673_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,There are a number of different ways in which a sewer may become a public sewer.
674_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drains serving only one curtilage cannot be adopted by the sewerage undertaker.
675_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,An agreement with the sewerage undertaker to adopt sewers on completion
676_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Under Section 104 (Agreements to adopt sewer or sewage disposal works at future date) of the Water Industry Act 1991, a sewerage undertaker may enter into an agreement with a developer to adopt a sewer at some time in the future subject to certain conditions."
677_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,In cases of dispute appeals may be made to the Director General of Water Services.
678_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Sewerage undertakers normally require the work to be carried out in accordance with their standards which are published in Sewers for Adoption.
679_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Requisition of a sewer from the sewerage undertaker
680_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Under Section 98 (Requisition of public sewer) of the Water Industry Act 1991, the owner or occupier of a building or proposed building or a local authority may requisition a sewer from the sewerage undertaker."
681_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The sewer is constructed by the sewerage undertaker who may use its rights of access to land.
682_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The person requisitioning the sewer may be required to contribute towards the cost of the sewer over a period of 12 years.
683_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Adoption by the sewerage undertaker at the request of the owner
684_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Under Section 102 (Adoption of sewers and disposal works) of the Water Industry Act 1991, a person may request a sewerage undertaker to adopt an existing sewer."
685_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The sewer should be in good condition and accessible.
686_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"In cases of dispute, appeals may be made to the Director General of Water Services."
687_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Adoption by the sewerage undertaker at its own volition
688_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Under Section 102 (Adoption of sewers and disposal works) of the Water Industry Act 1991, a sewerage undertaker may decide to adopt an existing sewer of its own volition."
689_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The sewer should be in good condition and accessible.
690_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"In cases of dispute, appeals may be made to the Director General of Water Services."
691_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Making connections to public sewers
692_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Under Section 106 (Right to communicate with public sewer) of the Water Industry Act 1991, the owner or occupier of a building has a right to connect to a public sewer subject to the following restrictions."
693_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where the public sewer is designated as either a foul sewer or a surface water sewer, the right is limited to connection of foul drains or surface water drains as appropriate."
694_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The manner of the connection would not be prejudicial to the public sewer system.
695_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,days notice is given to the sewerage undertaker of the intention to make the connection.
696_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Under Section 107 (Right of undertaker to undertake making of communication with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991, the sewerage undertaker may undertake the work of making the connection and recover their reasonable costs."
697_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Alternatively they may allow the developer to undertake to carry out the work under their supervision.
698_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Guidance on making connections to existing sewers is given in paragraphs 2.15 and 2.16.
699_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drains which could be used to drain other developments
700_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Section 112 of the Water Industry Act 1991 enables the sewerage undertaker to require that a drain or sewer be constructed in a different manner so that it may form part of the general system of drainage.
701_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The sewerage undertaker repays the person constructing the drain or sewer the additional costs of complying with the undertaker’s requirement.
702_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where land or property neighbouring the applicant’s site is likely to be developed, it would be prudent for the applicant to discuss the possibilities with the planning authority and the sewerage undertaker."
703_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Adoption of surface water sewers by the Highway Authority
704_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Under Section 37 (Highway created by dedication may become maintainable at public expense) or Section 38 (Power of highway authorities to adopt by agreement) of the Highways Act 1980, a highway authority may adopt, or agree to adopt in the future the drainage associated with a highway."
705_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Under Section 115 (Use of highway drains as sewers and vice versa) of the Water Industry Act 1991, the highway authority may agree that a highway drain may be used to drain rainwater from buildings."

710_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Sewers should be designed and constructed in accordance with the Protocol on Design Construction and Adoption of Sewers in England and Wales
711_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Sewers should be laid at an appropriate distance from buildings so as to avoid damage to the foundations
712_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The manholes and chambers, especially in private land, should be located so that they are, and continue to be, easily accessible manually or, if necessary, with maintenance equipment such as pipe jetters or mini-excavators."
713_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,This is of particular importance where the depth would justify mechanical excavation to undertake repair work
714_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Although design codes indicate that access points may be up to 200m apart, it is unlikely that it would be possible to rod or safely pressure jet small-diameter pipes over such a distance; 100m is more appropriate"

716_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"H1-2.17, H1-2.25 and Diagram 8."
717_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The distance from foundation to any drain is set out in H1-2.25.
718_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,When building over a sewer the recommended minimum distance is 3m (H4-1.6)
719_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,H1-2.51.
720_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Consult sewerage undertaker about access for plant
721_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The last access point on the house drain should be sized to allow man entry and should be located in an accessible position.
722_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"This access point should, as far as practicable, be located adjacent to the curtilage and preferably form an interface with the connection to the lateral where it runs outside the curtilage of the property to discharge into a sewer in a highway, into public open space or into third-party land"
723_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,H1-2.51
724_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"As this final manhole is likely to be in position where vehicle or plant loading is anticipated, its construction should accord with Sewers for Adoption"
725_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,House ‘collector’ drains serving each property should normally discharge into the sewer H1-2.13 to 2.16
726_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,via a single junction or a manhole
727_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Sewers should not be laid deeper than necessary, but in all cases the structural integrity of the pipe needs to be maintained."
728_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,This can normally be done by providing a cover to the top of the pipe barrel of 1.2m or 0.9m in highways or private land respectively.
729_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"If these depths are not practicable, special protection measures such as a concrete slab should be provided"

756_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Guidance
757_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Performance
758_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,In the Secretary of State’s view the requirements of H2 will be met if:
759_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,wastewater treatment systems:
760_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,have sufficient capacity to enable breakdown and settlement of solid matter in the wastewater from the buildings;
761_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,are sited and constructed so as to prevent overloading of the receiving water.

776_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,a notice giving information as to the nature and frequency of maintenance required for the cesspool or wastewater treatment system to continue to function satisfactorily is displayed within each of the buildings.
777_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Introduction to provisions
778_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"A wastewater treatment system may be 0.1 a septic tank, together with a drainage field or other means of secondary treatment, or other wastewater treatment system."
779_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Paragraphs 1.1 to 1.72 give guidance only 0.2 on the general principles relating to capacity, siting and ventilation of cesspools and wastewater treatment systems."
780_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Any discharge from a wastewater treatment system is likely to require a consent from the Environment Agency.
781_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Note: Initial contact with the Environment Agency is normally made as part of the planning procedures for non-mains drainage.
782_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where there have not previously been such discussions with the Environment Agency, those seeking Building Regulations approval for non-mains drainage should contact the area office of the Environment Agency in order to determine whether a consent to discharge is required and what parameters apply."
783_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,This should be done before an application is made for Building Regulations approval as it may have a direct bearing on the type of system that may be installed.
784_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Further information is available in the Environment Agency’s Pollution Prevention Guideline No. 4 Disposal of sewage where no mains drainage is available.
785_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Specialist knowledge is advisable in the 0.4 detailed design and installation of small sewage treatment works and guidance is given in BS 6297:1983 Code of practice for design and installation of small sewage treatment works and cesspools (see also paragraph 1.72).
786_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Options
787_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The use of non-mains foul drainage, such 1.1 as wastewater treatment systems or cesspools, should only be considered where connection to mains drainage is not practicable (see Approved Document H1)."
788_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Septic tanks provide suitable conditions for 1.2 the settlement, storage and partial decomposition of solids which need to be removed at regular intervals."
789_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The discharge can, however, still be harmful and will require further treatment from either a drainage field/mound or constructed wetland."
790_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,30
791_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Septic tanks with some form of secondary 1.3 treatment will normally be the most economic means of treating wastewater from small developments (e.g. 1 to 3 dwellings).
792_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Appropriate forms of secondary treatment for use with septic tanks (drainage fields, drainage mounds or constructed wetlands) are described in paragraphs 1.4 to 1.10 below."
793_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drainage fields typically consist of a system of sub-surface irrigation pipes which allow the effluent to percolate into the surrounding soil.
794_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Biological treatment takes place naturally in the aerated layers of soil.
795_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drainage fields may be used to provide secondary treatment in conjunction with septic tanks.
796_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,They may be used where the subsoil is sufficiently free-draining and the site is not prone to flooding or waterlogging at any time of year.
797_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The Environment Agency does not permit 1.6 drainage fields or drainage mounds in prescribed Zone 1 groundwater source-protection zones.
798_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drainage mounds are essentially drainage fields placed above the natural surface of the ground providing an aerated layer of soil to treat the discharge.
799_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Drainage mounds may be used where the subsoil is occasionally waterlogged, but where drainage fields would otherwise be suitable."
800_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Constructed wetlands (for example reed beds) are man-made systems which exploit the natural treatment capacity of certain wetland plants.
801_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Constructed wetlands discharging to a suitable watercourse may be used to treat septic tank effluent where drainage fields are not practical.
802_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The consent of the Environment Agency may be required.
803_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Packaged treatment works – This term is applied to a range of systems engineered to treat a given hydraulic and organic load using prefabricated components which can be installed with minimal site work.
804_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"They use a number of processes which are different in detail, all treat effluent to a higher standard than septic tank systems and this normally allows direct discharge to a watercourse."
805_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Packaged treatment works discharging to a suitable watercourse will normally be more economic for larger developments than septic tanks.
806_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,They should also be considered where space is limited or where other options are not possible.
807_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Cesspools – A cesspool is a watertight tank, installed underground, for the storage of sewage."
808_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,No treatment is involved.

817_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Marking
818_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Septic tanks should be sited at least 7m from any habitable parts of buildings, and preferably downslope."
819_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where they are to be emptied using a tanker, the septic tank should be sited within 30m of a vehicle access provided that the invert level of the septic tank is no more than 3m below the level of the vehicle access."
820_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,This distance may need to be reduced where the depth to the invert of the tank is more than 3m. There should also be a clear route for the hose such that the tank can be emptied and cleaned without hazard to the building occupants and without the contents being taken through a dwelling or place of work.
821_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Design and construction
822_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Septic tanks should have a capacity below the level of the inlet of at least 2,700 litres (2.7m³) for up to 4 users."
823_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The size should be increased by 180 litres for each additional user.
824_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Factory-made septic tanks are available in glass reinforced plastics, polyethylene or steel and should meet the requirements of BS EN 12566-1."
825_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Particular care is necessary in ensuring stability of these tanks.
826_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Septic tanks may also be constructed in brickwork or concrete, roofed with heavy concrete slabs."
827_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Brickwork should be of engineering bricks and be at least 220mm thick.
828_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The mortar should be a mix of 1:3 cement–sand ratio.
829_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,In situ concrete should be at least 150mm thick of C/25/P mix (see BS 5328).
830_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Septic tanks should prevent leakage of the contents and ingress of subsoil water and should be ventilated.
831_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Ventilation should be kept away from buildings.
832_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The inlet and outlet of a septic tank should be designed to prevent disturbance to the surface scum or settled sludge and should incorporate at least two chambers or compartments operating in series.
833_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Where the width of the tank does not exceed 1200mm the inlet should be via a dip pipe.
834_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"To minimise turbulence, provision should be made to limit the flow rate of the incoming foul water."
835_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,For steeply laid drains up to 150mm the velocity may be limited by laying the last 12m of the incoming drain at a gradient of 1 in 50 or flatter.
836_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The inlet and outlet pipes of a septic tank should be provided with access for sampling and inspection (see Approved Document H1, paragraph 2.48)."
837_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A notice should be fixed within the building describing the necessary maintenance.
838_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,An example of such wording is:
839_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,‘The foul drainage system from this property discharges to a septic tank and a <insert type of secondary treatment>.
840_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The tank requires monthly inspections of the outlet chamber or distribution box to observe that the effluent is free-flowing and clear.
841_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The septic tank requires emptying at least once every 12 months by a licensed contractor.
842_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The <insert type of secondary treatment> should be <insert details of maintenance of secondary treatment>.
843_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The owner is legally responsible to ensure that the system does not cause pollution, a health hazard or a nuisance.’"
844_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drainage fields and drainage mounds
845_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Paragraphs 1.27 to 1.44 give guidance on design and construction of drainage fields and drainage mounds to provide secondary treatment to the discharge from a septic tank or package treatment plant.
846_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Siting
847_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A drainage field or mound serving a wastewater treatment plant or septic tank should be located:
848_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,at least 10m from any watercourse or permeable drain;
849_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,at least 50m from the point of abstraction of any groundwater supply and not in any Zone 1 groundwater protection zone;

858_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Well drained and well aerated subsoils are usually brown, yellow or reddish in colour."
859_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Examples of subsoils with good percolation characteristics are sand, gravel, chalk, sandy loam and clay loam."
860_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,It is important that the percolation characteristics are suitable in both summer and winter conditions.
861_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Poorly drained or saturated subsoils are often grey or blue in colour.
862_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Brown and grey mottling usually indicates periodic saturation.
863_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Examples of subsoils with poor percolation characteristics are sandy clay, silty clay and clay."
864_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A preliminary assessment should be carried out including consultation with the Environment Agency and local authority to determine the suitability of the site.
865_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The natural vegetation on the site should also give an indication of its suitability for a drainage field.
866_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A trial hole should be dug to determine the position of the standing groundwater table.
867_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The trial hole should be a minimum of 1m2 in area and 2m deep, or a minimum of 1.5m below the invert of the proposed drainage field pipework."
868_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The groundwater table should not rise to within 1m of the invert level of the proposed effluent distribution pipes.
869_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"If the test is carried out in summer, the likely winter groundwater levels should be considered."
870_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,A percolation test should then be carried out to assess the further suitability of the proposed area.
871_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Percolation test method – A hole 300mm square should be excavated to a depth 300mm below the proposed invert level of the effluent distribution pipe.
872_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where deep drains are necessary the hole should conform to this shape at the bottom, but may be enlarged above the 300mm level to enable safe excavation to be carried out."
873_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Where deep excavations are necessary a modified test procedure may be adopted using a 300mm earth auger.
874_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Bore the test hole vertically to the appropriate depth taking care to remove all loose debris.

877_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Next day, refill the test section with water to a depth of at least 300mm and observe the time, in seconds, for the water to seep away from 75% full to 25% full level (i.e. a depth of 150mm)."
878_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Divide this time by 150.
879_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The answer gives the average time in seconds (Vp) required for the water to drop 1mm.
880_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The test should be carried out at least three times with at least two trial holes.
881_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The average figure from the tests should be taken.
882_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The test should not be carried out during abnormal weather conditions such as heavy rain, severe frost or drought."
883_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drainage field disposal should only be used when percolation tests indicate average values of Vp of between 12 and 100 and the preliminary site assessment report and trial hole tests have been favourable.
884_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,This minimum value ensures that untreated effluent cannot percolate too rapidly into groundwater.
885_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Where Vp is outside these limits effective treatment is unlikely to take place in a drainage field.
886_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"However, provided that an alternative form of secondary treatment is provided to treat the effluent from the septic tanks, it may still be possible to discharge the treated effluent to a soakaway."
887_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Design and construction
888_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drainage fields or mounds (see Diagrams 1 and 2) should be designed and constructed to ensure aerobic contact between the liquid effluent and the subsoil.
889_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Drainage fields should be constructed using perforated pipe, laid in trenches of a uniform gradient which should be not steeper than 1:200."
890_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Pipes should be laid on a 300mm layer of clean shingle or broken stone graded between 20mm and 50mm.

894_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Notes:
895_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"To provide venting of the filter, the upstream ends of the distribution pipes may be extended vertically above mound level and capped with a cowl or grille."
896_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Surface water runoff and uncontaminated seepage from the surrounding soil may be cut off by shallow interceptor drains and diverted away from the mound.
897_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,There must be no seepage of wastewater to such an interceptor drain.
898_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Where the permeable soil is slow draining and overlaid on an impervious layer, the mound filter system should be constructed on a gently sloping site."
899_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Trenches should be filled to a level 50mm above the pipe and covered with a layer of geotextile to prevent the entry of silt.
900_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The remainder of the trench can be filled with soil; the distribution pipes should be laid at a minimum depth of 500mm below the surface.
901_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Drainage trenches should be from 300mm to 900mm wide, with areas of undisturbed ground 2m wide being maintained between parallel trenches (see Diagram 1)."
902_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,An inspection chamber should be installed between the septic tank and the drainage field.
903_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Drainage fields should be set out as a continuous loop fed from the inspection chamber (see Diagram 1).
904_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"To calculate the floor area of the drainage field (At in m²), the following formula should be used:"
905_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,At = p x Vp x 0.25
906_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"where p is the number of persons served by the tank, Vp is the percolation value (secs/mm) obtained as described in paragraphs 1.34–1.38."
907_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Constructed wetlands/reed beds
908_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Reed bed treatment systems or other constructed wetland treatment systems can be used to provide secondary or tertiary treatment of effluent from septic tanks or packaged treatment works.
909_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The systems purify wastewater as it moves through the gravel bed around the rhizomes and roots, by removing organic matter (BOD), oxidising ammonia, reducing nitrate and removing a little phosphorus."
910_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"The mechanisms are complex and involve bacterial oxidation, filtration, sedimentation and chemical precipitation."
911_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Reed beds generally use the common reed (Phragmites australis); other types of plants used in constructed wetlands include the reed maces (Typha latifolia), the rush (Juncus effusus), the true bulrush (Schoenoplectus lacustris) as well as members of the sedge family (Carex) and the yellow flag (Iris pseudacorus)."
912_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Constructed wetlands should not be constructed in the shade of trees or buildings as this will result in poor or patchy growth.
913_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Although winter performance is generally similar with respect to removal of BOD and suspended solids, it tends to be poorer than in summer for removal of ammonia due to lower temperatures."
914_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,This should be taken into consideration during the design stage.
915_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"There are two main designs of constructed wetland system, horizontal flow and vertical flow."
916_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Horizontal flow systems are continuously fed with wastewater from one end.
917_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The effluent flows horizontally through the gravel bed over the full width of the bed to the outlet end (see Diagram 3).
918_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"Horizontal flow systems tend to be oxygen limited and they therefore tend not to be able to completely treat concentrated effluents, particularly those with high levels of ammonia."
919_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Horizontal flow systems require a level site.
920_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,As they only use a single bed less maintenance is required than with vertical flow systems.
921_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,Vertical flow systems are intermittently fed with wastewater from the top flooding the surface followed by a period of rest.
922_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,For this reason two or more beds are normally provided so that they can be used in rotation.
923_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,The flow is predominantly downward to an outlet at the bottom (see Diagram 4) and is collected by a drainage network at the base.
924_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,"They therefore require a fall of between 1m and 2m. Vertical flow systems can achieve much better oxygen transfer than horizontal flow systems and therefore achieve more complete treatment, particularly of ammonia."
925_UK_UK_Approved_Document_H,They generally require more maintenance than horizontal systems.
