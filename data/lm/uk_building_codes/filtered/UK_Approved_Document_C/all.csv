1_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Paragraphs H2 and J7 are excluded from Regulation 8 because they deal directly with prevention of the contamination of water.
2_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Parts E and M (which deal, respectively, with resistance to the passage of sound, and access to and use of buildings) are excluded from Regulation 8 because they address the welfare and convenience of building users."
3_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Part L is excluded from Regulation 8 because it addresses the conservation of fuel and power.
4_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"All these matters are amongst the purposes, other than health and safety, that may be addressed by Building Regulations."
5_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,MATERIALS AND WORkMANSHIP
6_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Any building work which is subject to the requirements imposed by Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations shall be carried out in accordance with regulation 7. Guidance on meeting these requirements on materials and workmanship is contained in Approved Document 7.
7_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Building Regulations are made for specific purposes, primarily the health and safety, welfare and convenience of people and for energy conservation."
8_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Standards and other technical specifications may provide relevant guidance to the extent that they relate to these considerations.
9_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"However, they may also address other aspects of performance or matters which, although they relate to health and safety etc., are not covered by the Building Regulations."
10_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"When an Approved Document makes reference to a named standard, the relevant version of the standard to which it refers is the one listed at the end of the publication."
11_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"However, if this version has been revised or updated by the issuing standards body, the new version may be used as a source of guidance provided it continues to address the relevant requirements of the Regulations."
12_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Use of guidance
13_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,THE APPROVED DOCUMENTS
14_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,This document is one of a series that has been approved by the First Secretary of State for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of Schedule 1 to and Regulation 7 of the Building Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/2214) for England and Wales.
15_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,At the back of this document is a list of all the documents that have been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for this purpose.
16_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Approved Documents are intended to provide guidance for some of the more common building situations.
17_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"However, there may well be alternative ways of achieving compliance with the requirements."
18_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Thus there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an Approved Document if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way.
19_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Other requirements
20_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The guidance contained in an Approved Document relates only to the particular requirements of the Regulations which the document addresses.
21_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The building work will also have to comply with the Requirements of any other relevant paragraphs in Schedule 1 to the Regulations.
22_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,There are Approved Documents which give guidance on each of the Parts of Schedule 1 and on Regulation 7.
23_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,LIMITATION ON REQUIREMENTS
24_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"In accordance with Regulation 8, the requirements in Part C of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations do not require anything to be done except for the purpose of securing reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about buildings (and any others who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings)."
25_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"The requirements in Part C address health and safety, and do not seek to protect the building fabric for its own sake."
26_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Thus the degree of precautions needed to comply with Part C will be influenced by the intended use of the building.
27_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Part C may not apply where it can be demonstrated that it will not serve to increase the protection to the health and safety of any persons habitually employed in the building in question.

30_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,OTHER HEALTH AND SAFETY LEGISLATION
31_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Health and safety regulations such as the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 may impose requirements on employers and those in control of buildings used as workplaces in relation to certain physical characteristics of the workplace."
32_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,There are also requirements in health and safety law which affect building design.
33_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"In particular, Regulation 11 of the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 places duties on designers including the need to take account of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 which relate to the design of, and materials used in, any structure intended for use as a workplace."
34_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Where such regulations apply there may be confusion as to whether the Building Regulations or health and safety requirements take precedence, as both will apply."
35_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Where an inspector for the purposes of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 has identified a contravention of such health and safety regulations they may seek to serve an improvement notice to secure compliance.
36_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"In such circumstances the inspector is prevented by virtue of Section 23(3) of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 from requiring measures which are more onerous than necessary to comply with any requirements of the Building Regulations, unless the specific requirement of health and safety regulations are themselves more onerous."

39_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,This Approved Document deals with the following Requirements which are contained in the Building Regulations 2010.
40_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Requirement Limits on application
41_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture
42_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Preparation of site and resistance to contaminants.
43_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"The ground to be covered by the building shall be reasonably free from any material that might damage the building or affect its stability, including vegetable matter, topsoil and pre-existing foundations."
44_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Reasonable precautions shall be taken to avoid danger to health and safety caused by contaminants on or in the ground covered, or to be covered by the building and any land associated with the building."
45_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Adequate sub-soil drainage shall be provided if it is needed to avoid:
46_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,the passage of ground moisture to the interior of the building;
47_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"damage to the building, including damage through the transport of water-borne contaminants to the foundations of the building."
48_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"For the purpose of this requirement, ‘contaminant’ means any substance which is or may become harmful to persons or buildings including substances which are corrosive, explosive, flammable, radioactive or toxic."
49_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Resistance to moisture
50_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"The walls, floors and roof of the building shall adequately protect the building and people who use the building from harmful effects caused by:"
51_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,ground moisture;
52_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,precipitation including wind-driven spray;

58_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,MATERIAL CHANGE OF USE
59_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Requirement C1 (2), which addresses resistance to contaminants, is now added to the requirements in Regulation 6 of the Building Regulations 2010 which should be complied with when there are certain material changes of use of buildings."
60_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Regulation 6 sets out which parts of Schedule 1 should be complied with when there is a material change of use of the building as defined in Regulation 5.
61_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The absence of such a requirement would have meant that occupiers of buildings in areas at risk from contaminants may remain unprotected after the building work to effect the change of use is complete.
62_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"In particular, some contaminants can penetrate the floors of buildings such as landfill gas arising from the deposition of waste and vapours from spills of organic solvents and fuel."
63_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,These contaminants can also migrate laterally from land outside the building.
64_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"In order to deal with this Requirement C1 (2) now applies to all changes of use that have a residential purpose or provide sleeping accommodation including hotels, i.e. as defined by Regulation 5 (a) to 5 (g) with the exception of 5 (e) public buildings and 5 (j) shops."
65_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Other types of buildings are covered by Health and Safety legislation so do not need addressing through the Building Regulations, for example workplace assessment, including radon measurements."
66_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Attention is drawn to the following extracts from the Building Regulations 2010.
67_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Interpretation (Regulation 2)
68_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"‘Room for residential purposes’ means a room, or suite of rooms, which is not a dwelling-house or a flat and which is used by one or more persons to live and sleep and includes a room in a hostel, a hotel, a boarding house, a hall of residence or a residential home, but does not include a a room in a hospital, or other similar establishment, used for patient accommodation."
69_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Meaning of material change of use (Regulation 5)
70_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"For the purposes of paragraph 8 (1)(e) of Schedule 1 to the Act and for the purposes of these Regulations, there is a material change of use where there is a change in the purposes for which or the circumstances in which a building is used, so that after the change:"
71_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"the building is used as a dwelling, where previously it was not;"
72_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"the building contains a flat, where previously it did not;"

104_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Historic buildings
105_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Material change of use or alterations to existing buildings may include work on historic buildings.
106_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Historic buildings include:
107_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,listed buildings;
108_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,buildings situated in conservation areas;
109_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,buildings which are of architectural and historical interest and which are referred to as a material consideration in a local authority’s development plan;
110_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"buildings of architectural and historical interest within national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and world heritage sites."
111_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The need to conserve the special characteristics of such historic buildings needs to be recognised3.
112_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"In such work, the aim should be to improve resistance to contaminants and moisture where it is practically possible, always provided that the work does not prejudice the character of the historic building, or increase the risk of long-term deterioration to the building fabric or fittings."
113_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,In arriving at an appropriate balance between historic building conservation and improving resistance to contaminants and moisture it would be appropriate to take into account the advice of the local planning authority’s conservation officer.
114_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Particular issues relating to work in historic buildings that warrant sympathetic treatment and where advice from others could therefore be beneficial include the following:
115_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,avoiding excessively intrusive gas protective measures;
116_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"ensuring that moisture ingress to the roof structure is limited and the roof can breathe3,4."
117_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Where it is not possible to provide dedicated ventilation to pitched roofs it is important to seal existing service penetrations in the ceiling and to provide draught proofing to any loft hatches.
118_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Any new loft insulation should be kept sufficiently clear of the eaves so that any adventitious ventilation is not reduced.
119_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"in the case of a building exceeding fifteen metres in height, B4 (1) (external fire spread – walls);"
120_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"in the case of a material change of use described in regulation 5(a), (b), (c), (d), (g), (h), (i) or, where the material charge provides new residential accommodation, (f), C1 (2) (resistance to contaminents);"
121_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"in the case of material change of use described in regulation 5(a), C2 (resistance to moisture);"
122_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"in the case of a material change of use described in regulation 5(a), (b), (c), (g), (h) or (i), E1 to E3 (resistance to the passage of sound);"
123_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"in the case of a material change of use described in regulation 5(e), where the public building consists or contains a school, E4 (acoustic conditions in schools);"
124_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"in the case of a material change of use described in Regulation 5(a) or (b), G2 (water efficiency) and G3(4) (hot water supply and systems: hot water supply to fixed baths);"
125_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"in the case of a material change of use described in regulation 5(c), (d), (e) or (j), M1 (access and use)."
126_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Where there is a material change of use of 2. part only of a building, such work, if any, shall be carried out as is necessary to ensure that:"
127_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,that part complies in all cases with any applicable requirement referred to in paragraph (1) (a);
128_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"in a case to which sub-paragraphs (b), (e), (f), (g) or (h) of paragraph (1) apply, that part complies with the requirements referred to in the relevant sub-paragraph; and"
129_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"in the case to which sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph (1) applies, the whole building complies with the requirement referred to in that sub-paragraph; and"
130_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,in the case to which sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (1) applies:
131_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,that part and any sanitary appliances provided in or in connection with that part comply with the requirements referred to in that sub-paragraph; and
132_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,the building complies with requirement M1 (a) of Schedule 1 to the extent that reasonable provision is made to provide either suitable independent access to that part or suitable access through the building to that part.

138_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"In most cases the rate at which gas seeps into buildings, mainly through floors, can be reduced by edge located sumps or sub-floor vents."
139_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,These are less intrusive than internal sumps or ducts that may involve taking up floors.
140_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,If flagged floors are taken up the stones should be indexed and their layout recorded to facilitate relaying when work is completed.
141_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Radon can be dispersed by ventilation strategies such as positive pressurisation.
142_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,These systems can often be accommodated in an unobtrusive manner.
143_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"If internal mechanical ventilation is used to disperse ground gases, it may affect the functioning of combustion appliances and may lead to the spillage of products of combustion into the building."

161_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Requirement C1 and deal with site preparation and resistance to contaminants under the headings ‘Clearance or treatment of unsuitable material’, ‘Resistance to contaminants’ and ‘Subsoil drainage’."
162_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Building Regulations are made for the purposes of securing the health, safety, welfare and convenience of persons in and about buildings."
163_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,This means that action may need to be taken to mitigate the effects of contaminants within the land associated with the building as well as protecting the building and persons in and about the building.
164_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"This includes action designed to prevent, i.e. inhibit, the ingress of radon gas into buildings to protect the health of occupants from exposure to indoor radon."
165_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Hazards associated with the ground may include the effects of vegetable matter including tree roots.
166_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"They may include health hazards associated with chemical and biological contaminants, and gas generation from biodegradation of organic matter."
167_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Hazards to the built environment can be physical, chemical or biological."
168_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Items such as underground storage tanks or foundations may create hazards to both health and the building.
169_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Physical hazards also C
170_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,include unstable fill or unsuitable hardcore containing sulphate.
171_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"In addition, the naturally occurring 0.5 radioactive gas radon and gases produced by some soils and minerals can be a hazard."
172_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Sections 4, 5 and 6 of this document 0.6 cover Requirement C2 and deal with resistance to moisture under the headings ‘Floors’, ‘Walls’ and ‘Roofs’."
173_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Moisture can rise from the ground to damage floors and the base of walls on any site, although much more severe problems can arise in sites that are liable to flooding."
174_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Driving rain or wind- driven spray from the sea or other water bodies adjacent to the building can penetrate walls or roofs directly, or through cracks or joints between elements, and damage the structure or internal fittings or equipment."
175_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Surface condensation from the water vapour generated within the building can cause moulds to grow which pose a health hazard to occupants.
176_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Interstitial condensation may cause damage to the structure.
177_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Spills and leaks of water, in rooms where sanitary fittings or fixed appliances that use water are installed (e.g. bathrooms and kitchens), may cause damage to floor decking or other parts of the structure."
178_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The diagrams in this Approved Document 0.7 have been set out to show typical situations and relationships between adjacent elements of construction.
179_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Conventional notations and hatching have been used to identify different materials.
180_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"However, the diagrams cannot show specific situations."
181_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,It remains the responsibility of the designer and builder to ensure that the building work meets all relevant aspects of the Building Regulations.
182_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Flood risk
183_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Policies set out in the National Planning 0.8 Policy Framework7 aim to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding, including requiring new development to be flood resilient and resistant, as and where appropriate."
184_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Flood resistance is not currently a requirement in Schedule 1 of the Building Regulations 2010 (and amendments).
185_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"However, when local considerations necessitate building in flood prone areas the buildings can be constructed to mitigate some effects of flooding such as:"
186_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,elevated groundwater levels or flow of subsoil water across the site – this can be alleviated by the provision of adequate sub-soil drainage (see Section 3);
187_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"sewer flooding due to backflow or surcharging of sewers or drains – this can be addressed through the use of non-return valves and anti-flooding devices (see Section 3, paragraph 3.6);"

194_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Land affected by contaminants
195_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The guidance given on resistance to 0.9 contaminants in Section 2 is for the purposes of the Building Regulations and their associated requirements.
196_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Users of this document should be aware that there may be further provisions for dealing with contaminants contained in planning guidance or legislation made under the regime set out in Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which may be supplementary to the requirements of the Building Regulations.
197_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"The Contaminated Land (England) Regulations 2006 (as amended 2012) make detailed provisions of a procedural nature to help give full effect to the Part IIA regime, and the statutory guidance161 provides a basis for enforcing authorities to apply the regime."
198_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Where contaminants are removed, treated or contained as part of the construction works, waste management law may apply."
199_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"If waste is removed for off-site disposal, the ‘Duty of Care’ and/or special waste requirements11 will apply."
200_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Redevelopment is often the most effective means of remediating land affected by contaminants.
201_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"This process is subject to controls under the Town and Country Planning Acts, and local planning authorities follow the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework7."
202_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Although environmental protection, planning and Building Regulations have different purposes their aims are similar."
203_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Consequently the processes for assessing the effects of pollutants and contaminants are similar.
204_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,An investigation or assessment to determine the characteristics of a site can be further developed for Building Regulations purposes when the form and construction of the buildings are known.
205_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,If appropriate data are gathered at the early stages it should not be necessary to completely re-
206_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,evaluate a site for Building Regulations purposes.
207_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Authorities that should be notified about contamination
208_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Other regulatory authorities may have an interest in land affected by contamination.
209_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"It may be necessary at any stage of the site investigation, risk assessment or remediation process to notify any unexpected events or change in outcomes to these regulatory authorities."
210_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The most likely situations are:

383_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,General concepts
384_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,To ensure safe development of land 2.6 affected by contaminants the principles of risk assessment (as set out in paragraph 2.8 below) should be followed.
385_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The general approach is founded on the concept of the ‘source–pathway–
386_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"receptor’ relationship, or pollutant linkage, where source refers to contaminants in or on the ground."
387_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,This is illustrated by the conceptual model34 in Diagram 2.
388_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"When land affected by contaminants is developed, receptors (i.e. buildings, building materials and building services, as well as people) are introduced onto the site and so it is necessary to break the pollutant linkages or condition them so that they do not pose a significant risk."
389_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"This can be achieved by: a. treating the contaminant (e.g. use of physical, chemical or biological processes to eliminate or reduce the contaminant’s toxicity or harmful properties);"
390_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,blocking or removing the pathway (e.g. isolating the contaminant beneath protective layers or installing barriers to prevent migration);
391_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"protecting or removing the receptor (e.g. changing the form or layout of the development, using appropriately designed building materials, etc.);"
392_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,removing the contaminant (e.g. excavating contaminated material).
393_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"The conceptual model is a textual or schematic hypothesis of the nature and sources of contamination, the pollution migration pathways and potential receptors, developed on the basis of the information from a preliminary assessment, and is refined during subsequent phases of investigation."

398_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Code of practice for In assessing the risks for land contamination 2.8 a tiered approach is adopted with an increasing level of detail required in progressing through the tiers.
399_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"The three tiers are: preliminary risk assessment, generic quantitative risk assessment (GQRA) and detailed quantitative risk assessment (DQRA)."
400_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Once the need for a risk assessment has been identified, it will always be necessary to undertake a preliminary risk assessment but, depending on the situation and the outcome, it may not be appropriate to do a more detailed risk assessment."
401_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Alternatively, it may be necessary to do only one or both of the more detailed risk assessments."
402_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"For each tier, the model procedures for the management of land contamination (CLR 1143) describes the stages of risk assessment that should be followed for identifying risks and making judgements about the consequences of land affected by contamination when developing a site."
403_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,These are outlined below:
404_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Hazard identification – developing the conceptual model by establishing contaminant sources, pathways and receptors."
405_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,This is the preliminary site assessment which consists of a desk study and a site walk-over in order to obtain sufficient information to obtain an initial understanding of the potential risks.
406_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,An initial conceptual model for the site can be based on this information.

408_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Collect further information and undertake exploratory site investigation to refine understanding of risks and the likelihood of pollutant linkages.

479_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Introduction
480_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,If unacceptable risks to the defined 2.15 receptor have been identified then these need to be managed through appropriate remedial measures.
481_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The risk management objectives are defined by the need to break the pollutant linkages using the methods outlined in paragraph 2.7 and described below.
482_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Other objectives will also need to be considered such as timescale, cost, remedial works, planning constraints and sustainability."
483_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Depending on the contaminant, three generic types of remedial measures can be considered: treatment, containment and removal."
484_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The containment or treatment of waste may require a waste management licence from the Environment Agency.
485_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"HSE Report HSG 66 Protection of workers and the general public during the development of contaminated land, 1991."

489_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"When building work is undertaken on sites affected by contaminants where control measures are already in place, care must be taken not to compromise these measures."
490_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"For example, cover systems may be breached when new building foundations are constructed, such as when extensions are added."
491_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Treatment
492_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,A wide range of treatment processes is now available for dealing with contaminants.
493_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Biological, chemical and physical techniques carried out either in or ex situ exist which may decrease one or more of the following features of the contaminants: mass, concentration, mobility, flux or toxicity."
494_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The choice of the most appropriate technique for a particular site is a highly site-specific decision for which specialist advice should be sought.
495_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Containment
496_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Containment in its widest sense usually means encapsulation of material containing contaminants but in the context of building development containment is often taken to mean cover systems.
497_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"However, in-ground vertical barriers may also be required to control lateral migration of contaminants."
498_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Cover systems involve the placement of one or more layers of materials over the site to achieve one or more of the following objectives:
499_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,break the pollutant linkage between receptors and contaminants;
500_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,sustain vegetation;
501_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,improve geotechnical properties; and
502_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,reduce exposure to an acceptable level.
503_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Some of the building structures, e.g. foundations, sub-structure and ground floor, may, dependent on the circumstances and construction, contribute to measures to provide effective protection of health from contaminants."
504_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Imported fill and soil for cover systems 2.20 should be assessed at source to ensure that it is suitable for use48.
505_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Design and dimensioning of cover systems, particularly soil based ones typically used for gardens, should take account of their long-term performance where intermixing of the soil cover with the contaminants in the ground can take place."
506_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Maintenance and monitoring may be necessary.
507_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Gradual intermixing due to natural effects and activities such as burrowing animals, gardening, etc. needs to be considered."
508_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Excavations by householders for garden features, etc. can penetrate the cover layer and may lead to exposure to contaminants."
509_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Further guidance on the design, construction and performance of cover layers is given in the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) Report SP12449."
510_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,18
511_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Removal
512_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,This involves the excavation and safe disposal to licensed landfill of the contaminants and contaminated material.
513_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Excavation can be targeted to contaminant ‘hot spots’, or it may be necessary to remove sufficient depth of contaminated material to accommodate a cover system within the planned site levels."
514_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Removal may not be viable depending on the extent and depth of the contaminants on the site and the availability of suitably licensed landfills.
515_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Imported fill should be assessed at source to ensure that there are no materials that will pose unacceptable risks to potential receptors.
516_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Further detailed guidance on all three types of remedial measure is given in the Environment Agency/NHBC R & D Publication 66 referred to above and in a series of CIRIA publications50–55.

519_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The hazards to consider are:
520_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Aggressive substances.
521_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"These include inorganic and organic acids, alkalis, organic solvents and inorganic chemicals such as sulphates and chlorides which may affect the long-term durability of construction materials (such as concrete, metals and plastics)."

544_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,METHANE AND OTHER GASES FROM THE GROUND
545_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Introduction
546_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The term ‘methane and other gases’ is used to define hazardous soil gases which either originate from waste deposited in landfill sites or are generated naturally.
547_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,It does not include radon which is dealt with separately in paragraphs 2.39 and 2.40.
548_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"However, the term does include volatile organic compounds (VOCs)."
549_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"As stated in Limitations on Requirements above, measures described in this document are the minimum that are needed to comply with the Building Regulations."
550_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Further actions may be necessary to deal with the requirements of other legislation.
551_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Landfill gas is generated by the action of micro-organisms on biodegradable waste materials in landfill sites.
552_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,It generally consists of methane and carbon dioxide together with small quantities of VOCs which give the gas its characteristic odour.
553_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Methane and oxygen deficient atmospheres (sometimes referred to as stythe or black-damp) containing elevated levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen can be generated naturally in coal mining areas.
554_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Methane and carbon dioxide can also be produced by organic rich soils and sediments such as peat and river silts.
555_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"A wide range of VOCs can also be present as a result of petrol, oil and solvent spillages."
556_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Methane and other gases can migrate through the subsoil and through cracks and fissures into buildings.
557_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Methane is an explosive and asphyxiating gas.
558_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Carbon dioxide although non-flammable is toxic.
559_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"VOCs are not only flammable and toxic but can also have a strong, unpleasant odour."
560_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Should any of these gases build up to hazardous levels in buildings then they can cause harm to health or compromise safety.
561_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,C
562_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Risk assessment
563_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The risk assessment process outlined in paragraph 2.8 should also be adopted for methane and other gases.
564_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Further investigation for hazardous soil gases may be required where the ground to be covered by the building and/or any land associated with the building is: a. On a landfill site, within 250m of the boundary of a landfill site or where there is suspicion that it is within the sphere of influence of such a site."
565_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The Environment Agency’s policy on building development on or near to landfills should be followed.
566_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,On a site subject to the wide scale deposition of biodegradable substances (including made ground or fill).
567_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"On a site that has been subject to a use that could give rise to petrol, oil or solvent spillages."
568_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"In an area subject to naturally occurring methane, carbon dioxide and other hazardous gases (e.g. hydrogen sulphide)."
569_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,There are documents that cover hazardous soil gases in these specific contexts:
570_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Waste Management Paper No. 2760 gives guidance on the generation and movement of landfill gas as well as techniques for its investigation.
571_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Complementary guidance is given in a document61 by the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM).

578_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Approved Document C Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moistureONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION C RESISTANCE TO CONTAMINANTS
579_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The Institute of Petroleum has prepared a guidance document covering petroleum retail sites62.
580_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"The BGS report on naturally occurring methane and other gases63 gives guidance on the geographical extent of these contaminants, the associated hazards and methods of site investigation."
581_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,This is supported by a report sponsored by the former DoE on methane and other gases in disused coal mining areas64.
582_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"In addition, CIRIA has produced three relevant guidance documents on methane and other gases which describe how such gases are generated and move within the ground65, methods of detection and monitoring66 and investigation strategies67."
583_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,During a site investigation for methane and other gases it is important to take measurements over a sufficiently long period of time in order to characterise gas emissions fully.
584_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"This should also include periods when gas emissions are likely to be higher, e.g. during periods of falling atmospheric pressure."
585_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"It is also important to establish not only the concentration of these gases in the ground but also the quantity of gas generating materials, their rate of gas generation, gas movement in the ground and gas emissions from the ground surface."
586_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,This is an important part of the risk estimation stage.
587_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Indications about the gas regime in the ground can be obtained through surface emission rate and borehole flow rate measurements, and guidance on this is given in CIRIA Reports 15168 and 15269."
588_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Construction activities undertaken as part of building development can alter the gas regime on the site.
589_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"For example, a site strip can increase surface gas emissions as can piling and excavation for foundations, and dynamic compaction can push dry biodegradable waste into moist, gas-"
590_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,active zones.
591_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"When assessing gas risks in the context of traditional housing there is a need to consider two pathways for human receptors: (i) gas entering the dwelling through the sub-structure, and building up to hazardous levels, and (ii) subsequent householder exposure in garden areas which can include where outbuildings (e.g. garden sheds and greenhouses) and extensions are constructed, and where there may also be excavations for garden features (e.g. ponds)."
592_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Guidance on undertaking gas risk assessment is given in CIRIA Report 15269, and the GaSIM model is also available for assessing gas emissions from landfill sites70."
593_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,There is further discussion of gas risk assessment in the Defra/
594_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Environment Agency document CLR 1143.
595_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,20
596_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"CIRIA Report 14972 and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) Partners in Technology (PIT) report73 describe a range of ground gas regimes (defined in terms of soil gas concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide as well as borehole flow rate measurements) which can be helpful in assessing gas risks."
597_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Depending on the proposed use, for non-domestic development the focus might be on the building only, but the general approach is the same."
598_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Remedial measures
599_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,If the risks posed by the gas are 2.36 unacceptable then these need to be managed through appropriate building remedial measures.
600_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Site-wide gas control measures may be required if the risks on any land associated with the building are deemed unacceptable.
601_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Such control measures include removal of the gas generating material or covering together with gas extraction systems.
602_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Further guidance is contained in CIRIA Report 14972.
603_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Generally speaking, expert advice should be sought in these circumstances."
604_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Gas control measures for dwellings consist of a gas resistant barrier across the whole footprint (i.e. walls and floor) above an extraction (or ventilation) layer from which gases can be dispersed and vented to the atmosphere.
605_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"They are normally passive, i.e. gas flow is driven by stack (temperature difference) and wind effects."
606_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Consideration should be given to the design and layout of buildings to maximise the driving forces of natural ventilation.
607_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Further guidance on this and detailed practical guidance on the construction of protective measures for housing is given in the BRE/Environment Agency report 43 CLR 11.

623_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The DETR/Arup Environmental report74 compares the performance of a range of commonly used gas control measures and can be used as a guide to the design of such measures.
624_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Gas control measures for non-domestic buildings use the same principles as those used for housing, and the DETR/Arup Environmental report can also be used as a guide to design."
625_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Expert advice should be sought as the floor area of such buildings can be large and it is important to ensure that gas is adequately dispersed from beneath the floor.
626_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The use of mechanical (as opposed to passive) systems and monitoring and alarm systems may be necessary.
627_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"There is a need for continued maintenance and calibration of these systems, so they are more appropriate with non-domestic buildings (as opposed to dwellings) since there is usually scope for this."
628_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Again, expert advice should be sought."
629_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Special sub-floor ventilation systems are carefully designed to ensure adequate performance and should not be modified unless subjected to a specialist review of the design.
630_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Such ventilation systems, particularly those using powered ventilation, are unlikely to be appropriate for owner occupied properties as there is a risk of interference by users."
631_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,RADON
632_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive colourless and odourless gas which is formed in small quantities by radioactive decay wherever uranium and radium are found.
633_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,It can move through the subsoil and so into buildings.
634_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Some parts of the country, notably the West Country, have higher levels than elsewhere."
635_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Exposure to high levels for long periods increases the risk of developing lung cancer.
636_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"To reduce this risk all new buildings, extensions and conversions, whether residential or non-domestic, built in areas where there may be elevated radon emissions, may need to incorporate precautions against radon."
637_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Guidance on whether an area is susceptible to radon, and appropriate protective measures, can be obtained from BRE Report BR 21175."
638_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The maps in BR 211 are based on the indicative atlas published by Public Health England (formerly the Health Protection Agency) and the British Geological Survey.
639_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,Radon risk reports may be used as an alternative approach to the maps for assessing the need for protective measures.
640_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,These reports are available from:

646_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,BR 211 provides guidance on basic radon protective measures appropriate in areas where 3% to 10% of homes and full radon protective measures in areas where more than 10% of homes are predicted to have radon at or above the Radon Action Level of 200Bq/m3.
647_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Note: Use of the alternative radon risk reports approach will provide a more accurate assessment of whether radon protective measures are necessary and, if needed, the level of protection that is appropriate."
648_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,The Ionising Radiations Regulations76 and other legislation set out relevant requirements including a national reference level for radon in workplaces.
649_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,See also the BRE guide Radon in the workplace77.

662_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"The provisions which follow assume that 3.1 the site of the building is not subject to general flooding (see paragraph 0.8) or, if it is, that appropriate steps are being taken."
663_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Where the water table can rise to within 0.25m of the lowest floor of the building, or where surface water could enter or adversely affect the building, either the ground to be covered by the building should be drained by gravity, or other effective means of safeguarding the building should be taken."
664_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,If an active subsoil drain is cut during 3.3 excavation and if it passes under the building it should be:
665_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,re-laid in pipes with sealed joints and have access points outside the building; or
666_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,re-routed around the building; or
667_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,re-run to another outfall (see Diagram 3).
668_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"Where there is a risk that groundwater beneath or around the building could adversely affect the stability and properties of the ground, consideration should be given to site drainage or other protection (see Section 4: Floors)."
669_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,"For protecting low lying buildings or 3.5 basements from localised flooding where foul water drainage also receives rainwater, refer to Approved Document H (Drainage and waste disposal)."
670_UK_UK_Approved_Document_C,In heavy rainfall these systems surcharge and where preventative measures are not taken this could lead to increased risks of flooding within the property.
