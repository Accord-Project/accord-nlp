820_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Commissioning of ﬁxed building services
821_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Water heaters require the input of energy to raise the temperature of water.
822_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,It is therefore necessary to ensure their efﬁciency by proper installation and commissioning.
823_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,"Fixed building services, including controls, should be commissioned by testing and adjusting as necessary to ensure that they use no more fuel and power than is reasonable in the circumstances."
824_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Commissioning means the advancement of these systems from the state of static completion to working order to achieving compliance with Part L. For each system it includes setting-to-
825_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,"work, regulation (that is testing and adjusting repetitively) to achieve the speciﬁed performance, the calibration, setting up and testing of the associated automatic control systems, and recording of systems and the performance test results that have been accepted as satisfactory."
826_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Not all ﬁxed building services will need to be commissioned.
827_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,"For example, with some systems it is not possible as the only controls are ‘on’ and ‘off’ settings."
828_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,In other cases commissioning would be possible but in the speciﬁc circumstances would have no effect on energy use.
829_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Where commissioning is carried out it must be done in accordance with a procedure approved by the Secretary of State.
830_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,For new and existing dwellings the approved procedure for hot water systems is set out in the Domestic Heating Compliance Guide; for buildings other than dwellings in CIBSE Commissioning Code M.
831_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Commissioning must be carried out in such a way as not to prejudice compliance with any applicable health and safety requirements.
832_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Commissioning is often carried out by the person who installs the system.
833_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Sometimes it may be carried out by a subcontractor or by a specialist ﬁrm.
834_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,It is important that whoever carries it out follows the relevant approved procedure in doing so.

1045_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,The calculation methodology is to be used to assess compliance against the water performance targets in Regulation 36 as set out below.
1046_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,It is not a design tool for water supply and drainage systems.
1047_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,It is also not capable of calculating the actual potable water consumption of a new dwelling.

1055_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,The calculation methodology requires A2 the use of water consumption ﬁgures provided from manufacturers’ product details.
1056_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,"Before the assessment can be carried out, ﬁgures will need to be collected from manufacturers’ product information to determine the consumption of each terminal ﬁtting, including:"
1057_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,WCs
1058_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Flushing capacity for the WC suite including consumption at full and part ﬂush for dual ﬂush WCs.
1059_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,"Where multiple WCs are speciﬁed with various ﬂushing capacities, the average effective ﬂushing volume must be used as set out in paragraphs A8 and A11."
1060_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Bidets
1061_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,"Bidets are excluded from the water efﬁciency calculator for new dwellings due to their minimal water consumption, and although there is insufﬁcient research to quantify this consumption, anecdotal evidence shows that there is evidence that bidets often displace other water consumption rather than increase consumption."
1062_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Taps
1063_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,"Flow rate of each tap, at full ﬂow rate in litres per minute measured at a dynamic pressure of 3±0.2 bar (0.3±0.02 MPa) for high pressure (Type 1) taps, or at a dynamic pressure of 0.1±0.02 bar (0.01±0.002 MPa) for low pressure (Type 2) taps (BS EN 200:2008, sanitary tapware, single taps and combination taps for supply systems of type 1 and 2. General technical speciﬁcations) including any reductions achieved with ﬂow restrictions."
1064_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Where multiple taps are to be provided (e.g. separate hot and cold taps) the ﬂow rate of each tap will be needed in order to calculate an average ﬂow rate in accordance with paragraphs A8 to A10.
1065_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,"For ‘click taps’ and other taps with a ‘water break’, the manufacturer’s stated full ﬂow rate should be used to perform calculations (measured as described above)."
1066_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Do not use the ﬂow rate at the break point.
1067_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,A factor for percentage of ﬂow rate is already assumed within the use factor for taps.
1068_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,There is currently no research to provide a separate use factor for ‘click taps’ so a standard use factor is applied.
1069_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Taps on baths should not be included in the calculation as the water consumption from bath taps is taken account of in the use factor for baths.
1070_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Baths
1071_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,"Total capacity of the bath to overﬂow, in litres (excluding displacement, this is already included in the use factor for baths)."
1072_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,"Where multiple baths are speciﬁed with various capacities, the average must be used as set out in paragraphs A8 to A10."
1073_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Spa hot tubs are not included in the water efﬁciency calculator as they are generally not ﬁlled on a daily basis and their water consumption over a year is minimal.
1074_UK_UK_Approved_Document_G,Dishwashers
