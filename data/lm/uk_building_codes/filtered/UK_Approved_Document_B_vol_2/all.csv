0_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Section 1: Fire detection and alarm systems
1_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,General provisions
2_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,All buildings should have arrangements for detecting fire and raising the alarm.
3_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In most buildings, fires are detected by people, either by sight or smell, and therefore often nothing more is needed."
4_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In some small buildings/premises, the means of raising the alarm may be simple (for example, a shouted warning)."
5_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In assessing appropriate solutions, warnings need to be heard and understood throughout the premises."
6_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Fire detection and alarm systems
7_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Other than for some small buildings/premises, an electrically operated fire alarm system should be provided."
8_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In some situations, the alarm should be operated by a fire detection system."
9_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The detailed specification should be compatible with the fire strategy for the building.
10_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,NOTE:
11_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The term ‘fire alarm system’ describes the combination of components for giving an audible and/or other perceptible warning of fire.
12_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,NOTE:
13_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In this document, the term ‘fire detection system’ describes any type of automatic sensor network and associated control and indicating equipment."
14_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Sensors may be sensitive to smoke, heat, gaseous combustion products or radiation."
15_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Automatic sprinkler systems can also be used to operate a fire alarm system.
16_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In ‘residential (institutional)’ and ‘residential (other)’ occupancies (purpose groups 2(a) and 2(b)), automatic fire detection and alarms should be provided."
17_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Automatic fire detection and alarm systems should be provided in non-residential occupancies where a fire could break out in an unoccupied part of the premises (e.g. a storage area or a part of the building that is not visited on a regular basis) and prejudice the means of escape from occupied part(s) of the premises.
18_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Automatic fire detection will also be necessary where fire protection systems, such as pressure differential systems or door releases, need to operate automatically."
19_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Every building design should be assessed individually.
20_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"General guidance on the category of fire detection system that may need to be provided within a building can be found in Table A1 of BS 5839-1. 1.8 Where an electrically operated fire detection and alarm system is provided, it should comply with BS 5839-1."
21_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,BS 5839-1 specifies three categories of system.
22_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Category L – for the protection of life.
23_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Category M – manual fire detection and alarm systems.
24_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Category P – for property protection.

27_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Category L systems are divided into the following.
28_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,systems installed throughout the protected building.
29_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,systems installed only in defined parts of the protected building (a category L2 system will normally include the coverage required of a category L3 system).
30_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"systems designed to warn of fire at an early enough stage to enable all occupants, other than possibly those in the room where the fire started, to escape safely before the escape routes become impassable because of fire, smoke or toxic gases."
31_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"systems installed within those parts of the escape routes that comprise circulation areas and circulation spaces, such as corridors and stairs."
32_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"systems in which the protected area(s) and/or the location of detectors are designed to satisfy a specific fire safety objective (other than that of a category L1, L2, L3 or L4 system)."
33_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Type P systems are divided into the following.

38_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Call points should be installed in accordance with BS 5839-1. Type B (indirect operation) call points of BS EN 54-11 should only be used with the approval of the building control body.
39_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"A voice alarm system complying with BS 5839-8, and giving a fire warning different from other signals in general use, may be considered if either of the following applies."
40_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,People might not respond quickly to a fire warning.
41_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,People are unfamiliar with the fire warning arrangements.
42_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In premises where lots of members of the public are present, an initial general alarm may be undesirable."
43_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Any fire alarm system that first alerts staff should comply with BS 5839-1.
44_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Where the escape strategy is based on simultaneous evacuation, actuation of the fire alarm system should give warning from all fire alarm sounders."
45_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Where phased evacuation is planned, a staged alarm system is appropriate."
46_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,See paragraph 3.21.
47_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,BS 9999 provides guidance for fire detection and alarm systems in buildings containing atria.
48_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Warnings for people with impaired hearing
49_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Clause 18 of BS 5839-1 gives detailed guidance on the design and selection of fire alarm warnings for people with impaired hearing.
50_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In buildings or part of a building where people may be in relative isolation, a visual and audible fire alarm may be the most appropriate solution."
51_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In buildings where the population is managed, a vibrating personal paging system may be more appropriate."

57_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Third party certification schemes for fire protection products and related services are an effective means of providing assurances of quality, reliability and safety."
58_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Interface between fire detection and alarm systems and other systems
59_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Fire detection and alarm systems sometimes trigger other systems.
60_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The interface between systems must be reliable.
61_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Particular care should be taken if the interface is facilitated via another system.

72_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Means of escape should be provided from any point on a storey to the storey exit, for all types of building."
73_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The general principle is that any person confronted by a fire within a building can turn away from it and escape safely.
74_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"For small shop, office, industrial, storage and other similar premises, the guidance on small premises (see section 4) may be followed instead of the provisions in this section, if they meet both of the following conditions."
75_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,No storey has an area more than 280m2.
76_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,There is a maximum of two storeys plus a basement storey.

78_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Number of escape routes and exits
79_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The number of escape routes and exits that should be provided depends on both of the following.
80_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"The number of occupants in the room, tier or storey."
81_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The limits on travel distance to the nearest exit given in Table 2.1 (which apply only to the nearest exit; other exits may be further away).
82_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In multi-storey buildings, if more than one stair is needed for vertical escape, every part of each storey should have access to more than one stair."
83_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,An area may be in a dead end provided the alternative stair is accessible.
84_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In mixed use buildings, separate means of escape should be provided from any storeys or parts of storeys used for the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose groups 1, 2 and 5)."

912_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The capacity of stairs not less than 1100mm wide may also be obtained by using the formulas in paragraph 3.18.
913_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Unless a central handrail is provided, stairs with a rise of more than 30m should be a maximum width of 1400mm (see paragraph 3.10)."
914_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Stairs wider than 2000mm should have a central handrail (see paragraph 3.11).
915_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"As an alternative to Table 3.2, the capacity of stairs 1100mm wide or wider can be found using either of the following formulas:"

1020_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,This table assumes a phased evacuation of the fire floor first followed by evacuation of not more than two floors at a time.
1021_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Unless a central handrail is provided, stairs with a rise of more than 30m should be a maximum width of 1400mm (see paragraph 3.10)."
1022_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"As an alternative to using this table, the minimum width (in mm) may be calculated from: (P10) – 100 where P = the number of people on the most heavily occupied storey."
1023_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"However, the minimum width of a stair should be 1000mm."
1024_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Building Regulations 2010 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition 35"
1025_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,B1Table 3.3 Minimum width of stairs designed for phased evacuationONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Worked example using Table 3.3
1026_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"What is the minimum width needed for the stairs serving a 15 storey office building (ground + 14 office floors), assuming a total population of 2500 people (excluding the ground floor population, which does not use the stairs)?"
1027_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"To satisfy the travel distance limitations, three stairs are required."
1028_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The building is over 45m in height and designed for phased evacuation.
1029_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,It has been decided to discount one stair to take account of fire and rescue service operations as described in paragraph 3.20.
1030_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Therefore:
1031_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,• Number of people per storey = 2500/14 = 179.
1032_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Each remaining stair must be able to accommodate half the population of one storey (i.e. 90 people).
1033_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Thus each stair should be 1000mm wide (maximum capacity 100 people).
1034_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21.
1035_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum width needed for 90 people in Table 2.3).
1036_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"• At least one of those stairs needs to be a firefighting stair, therefore a minimum width of 1100mm is needed (see note 2 to Table 3.1)."
1037_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Additional worked example using Table 3.3
1038_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"What is the minimum width needed for the stairs serving a 9 storey office building (ground + 8 office floors), assuming a total population of 1920 people (excluding the ground floor population, which does not use the stairs)?"
1039_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"To satisfy the travel distance limitations, two stairs are required."
1040_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"As both stairs need to be entered at each level through a protected lobby (see paragraph 3.21), both stairs can be assumed to be available (see paragraph 3.15)."
1041_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Therefore:
1042_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,• Number of people per storey = 1920/8 = 240.
1043_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,• Each stair must be able to accommodate half the population of one storey (i.e. 240/2 = 120 people).
1044_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"• Thus both stairs would require a width of 1100mm (maximum capacity 120 people) according to Table 3.3, but:"
1045_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"• Each storey exit needs to be able to serve 240 people, because of discounting as described in paragraph 2.21."
1046_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The minimum exit width needed for 240 people in Table 2.3 is 1200mm.
1047_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"As described in paragraph 3.10a, the stair should be at least as wide as the storey exit serving it."
1048_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,• The required stair width is therefore 1200mm.

1052_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"If it is also a protected shaft (i.e. it passes from one compartment to another) or firefighting shaft, additional guidance in Sections 8 and 17 applies."

2941_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Introduction
2942_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The following assumptions enable a reasonable standard of resistance to the spread of fire to be specified.
2943_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The size of a fire depends on the compartmentation within the building.
2944_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"A fire may involve a complete compartment, but will not spread to other compartments."
2945_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"The intensity of fire is related to the building use, but can be moderated by a sprinkler system."
2946_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Fires in ‘residential’ and ‘assembly and recreation’ buildings (purposes groups 1, 2 and 5) represent a greater risk to life."
2947_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,A building on the far side of the relevant boundary meets both of the following conditions.
2948_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Has a similar elevation to the one in question.
2949_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Is at the same distance from the common boundary.
2950_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The radiated heat passing through any part of the fire resisting external wall may be discounted.
2951_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over the provisions within this section."
2952_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"If a reduced separation distance between buildings, or increased amount of unprotected area, is required, smaller compartments should be considered."
2953_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Boundaries
2954_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The fire resistance of a wall depends on its distance from the relevant boundary (see Diagram 13.1).
2955_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Separation distances are measured to boundaries to ensure that the location and design of buildings on adjoining sites have no influence on the building under consideration.
2956_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The boundary that a wall faces is the relevant boundary (Diagram 13.2).
2957_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,It may be one of the following.

3159_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Vertical parts of a pitched roof, such as dormer windows, should be included, only if the slope of the roof exceeds 70 degrees."
3160_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,It is a matter of judgement whether a continuous run of dormer windows that occupies most of a steeply pitched roof should be treated as a wall rather than a roof.
3161_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Portal frames
3162_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Portal frames are often used in single storey industrial and commercial buildings where there may be no need for fire resistance of the structure (requirement B3).
3163_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"However, where a portal framed building is near a relevant boundary, the external wall near the boundary may need fire resistance to restrict the spread of fire between buildings."
3164_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"It is generally accepted that a portal frame acts as a single structural element because of the moment-resisting connections used, especially at the column/rafter joints."
3165_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Thus, in cases where the external wall of the building cannot be wholly unprotected, the rafter members of the frame, as well as the column members, may need to be fire protected."
3166_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The design method for this is set out in SCI Publication P313.
3167_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,NOTE:
3168_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The recommendations in the SCI publication for designing the foundation to resist overturning do not need to be followed if the building is fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.
3169_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,NOTE:

3176_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"There is brick, block or concrete protection to the columns up to a protected ring beam providing lateral support."
3177_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,There is some form of roof venting to give early heat release.
3178_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"(The roof venting could be, for example, PVC rooflights covering some 10% of the floor area and evenly spaced over the floor area.)"
3179_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Methods for calculating acceptable unprotected area
3180_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Two simple methods are given for calculating the acceptable amount of unprotected area in an external wall that is a minimum of 1000mm from any point on the relevant boundary.
3181_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,More precise methods are described in BRE report BR 187 and may be used instead.
3182_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,When using BR 187 the following radiation intensity at each unprotected area should be assumed.

4190_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Appendix B: Performance of materials, products and structures"
4191_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Introduction
4192_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Much of the guidance in this document is given in terms of performance classifications in relation to British or European Standards.
4193_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In such cases, it will be necessary to demonstrate that a system or product can meet the relevant performance classification."
4194_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,This will be achieved if the system or product complies with one of the following.
4195_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,They should be in accordance with a specification or design that has been shown by a specific test to be capable of meeting that performance classification.
4196_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,They should have been designed by using relevant design standards in order to meet that performance classification.
4197_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"They should have been assessed by applying relevant test evidence, in lieu of carrying out a specific test, as being capable of meeting that performance classification."
4198_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,NOTE:
4199_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Some products are subject to Classification Without Further Testing (CWFT).
4200_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"For the purposes of this approved document, such products can be considered to have been shown to be capable of meeting a performance specification as per paragraph B1a."
4201_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Any test evidence used to demonstrate the fire performance classification of a product or system should be carefully checked to ensure that it is applicable to the intended use.
4202_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Small differences in detail, such as fixing method, joints, dimensions, the introduction of insulation materials and air gaps (ventilated or not), can significantly affect the performance."
4203_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Assessments should not be regarded as a way to avoid a test where one is necessary.
4204_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Assessments should only be carried out where sufficient relevant test evidence is available.
4205_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Relevant test evidence is unlikely to be provided by test standards which have different classification criteria.
4206_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Where it is proposed to assess the classification of a product or system in lieu of carrying out a specific test (as in paragraph B1c), this should be done in accordance with the relevant standard for extended application for the test in question and should include details of the test evidence that has been used to support the assessment."
4207_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"For performance classifications where there is no specific standard for extended application, assessment reports should be produced in accordance with the principles of BS EN 15725 and should include details of the test evidence that has been used to support the assessment."
4208_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Further information on best practice is provided in the Passive Fire Protection Forum’s Guide to Undertaking Technical Assessments of the Fire Performance of Construction Products Based on Fire Test Evidence.
4209_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,NOTE:
4210_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Regulation 7(2) limits components used in or on the external walls of certain buildings to materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or class A1 (see Section 12)."
4211_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Assessments cannot be used to demonstrate compliance with this requirement.
4212_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Tests and assessments should be carried out by organisations with the necessary expertise.
4213_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"For example, organisations listed as ‘notified bodies’ in accordance with the European Construction 136 Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition Building Regulations 2010"

4217_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Products Regulation or laboratories accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) for the relevant test standard can be assumed to have the necessary expertise.
4218_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,NOTE:
4219_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Standard fire tests do not directly measure fire hazard.
4220_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,They measure or assess the response of a material or system to exposure to one or more aspects of fire conditions.
4221_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Performance in fire tests is only one of a number of factors that should be taken into account.
4222_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Reaction to fire
4223_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Reaction to fire relates to the degree to which a product will contribute, by its own decomposition, to a fire under specified conditions."
4224_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Products, other than floorings, are classified as A1, A2, B, C, D, E or F (with class A1 being the highest performance and F being the lowest) in accordance with BS EN 13501-1."
4225_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Class F is assigned when a product fails to attain class E. Untested products cannot be classified in accordance with BS EN 13501-1.
4226_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Materials covered by the Classification Without Further Testing (CWFT) process can be found by accessing the European Commission’s website https://eur-lex.europa.eu/.
4227_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"The classes of reaction to fire performance of A2, B, C, D and E are accompanied by additional classifications related to the production of smoke (s1, s2, s3), with s1 indicating the lowest production, and/or flaming droplets/particles (d0, d1, d2), with d0 indicating the lowest production."
4228_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,NOTE:
4229_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"When a classification includes s3, d2 this means that there is no limit set for smoke production and/or flaming droplets/particles."
4230_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"To reduce the testing burden on manufacturers, BS EN 13238 defines a number of standard substrates that produce test results representative of different end use applications."
4231_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"The classification for reaction to fire achieved during testing is only valid when the product is used within this field of application, i.e. when the product is fixed to a substrate of that class in its end use."
4232_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The standard substrate selected for testing should take account of the intended end use applications (field of application) of the product and represent end use substrates that have a density of a minimum of 75% of the standard substrate’s nominal density.
4233_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Standard substrates include gypsum plasterboard (BS EN 520) with a density of 700+/-100kg/m3, calcium silicate board (BS EN 14306) 870+/-50kg/m3 and fibre-cement board 1800+/-200kg/m3."
4234_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,NOTE:
4235_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Standard calcium silicate board is not representative of gypsum plasterboard end use (due to the paper layer), but would be representative of most gypsum plasters (with densities of more than 650kg/m3)."
4236_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,NOTE:
4237_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Classifications based on tests using a plasterboard substrate would also be acceptable for products bonded to a gypsum plaster end use substrate.
4238_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,National classifications for reaction to fire
4239_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"This document uses the European classification system for reaction to fire set out in BS EN 13501-1; however, there may be some products lawfully on the market using the classification system set out in previous editions."

4298_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,A thermoplastic material alone when used as a lining to a wall or ceiling cannot be assumed to protect a substrate.
4299_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The surface rating of both thermoplastic material and substrate must therefore meet the required classification.
4300_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"If, however, the thermoplastic material is fully bonded to a non-thermoplastic substrate, then only the surface rating of the composite needs to meet the required classification."

4326_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Fire resistance
4327_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Common to all of the provisions of Part B of the Building Regulations is the property of fire resistance.
4328_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Fire resistance is a measure of one or more of the following.
4329_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Resistance to collapse (loadbearing capacity), which applies to loadbearing elements only, denoted R in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance."
4330_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Resistance to fire penetration (integrity), denoted E in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance."
4331_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Resistance to the transfer of excessive heat (insulation), denoted I in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance."
4332_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The standards of fire resistance necessary for a particular building are based on assumptions about the severity of fires and the consequences should an element fail.
4333_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Fire severity is estimated in very broad terms from the use of the building (its purpose group), on the assumption that the building contents (which constitute the fire load) are similar for buildings with the same use."
4334_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Because the use of buildings may change, a precise estimate of fire severity based on the fire load due to a particular use may be misleading."
4335_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Therefore if a fire engineering approach of this kind is adopted, the likelihood that the fire load may change in the future needs to be considered."
4336_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"Performance in terms of the fire resistance to be achieved by elements of structure, doors and other forms of construction is classified in accordance with one of the following."

4834_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,Application of the fire resistance standards in Table B4
4835_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,The following guidance should be used when applying the fire resistance standards in Table B4.
4836_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"If one element of structure supports or carries or gives stability to another, the fire resistance of the supporting element should be no less than the minimum period of fire resistance for the other element (whether that other element is loadbearing or not)."
4837_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"In some circumstances, it may be reasonable to vary this principle, for example:"
4838_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,if the supporting structure is in the open air and is not likely to be affected by the fire in the building
4839_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"if the supporting structure is in a different compartment, with a fire-separating element (that has the higher standard of fire resistance) between the supporting and the separated structure"
4840_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,if a plant room on the roof needs greater fire resistance than the elements of structure that support it.
4841_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"If an element of structure forms part of more than one building or compartment, that element should be constructed to the standard of the higher of the relevant provisions."
4842_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"If, due to the slope of the ground, one side of a basement is open at ground level (allowing smoke to vent and providing access for firefighting) for elements of structure in that storey it may be appropriate to adopt the standard of fire resistance that applies to above-ground structures."
4843_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"d. Although most elements of structure in a single storey building may not need fire resistance, fire resistance is needed if one of the following applies to the element."
4844_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_2,"It is part of, or supports, an external wall, and there is provision in the guidance on requirement B4 to limit the extent of openings and other unprotected areas in the wall."
