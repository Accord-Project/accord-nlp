1046_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,This appendix sets out the levels of moisture and other pollutants that the provisions in this approved document are designed to control.
1047_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,The provisions are designed to control all of the following.
1048_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,"Moisture levels, as described in paragraph B2."
1049_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,"Indoor air pollutants, as described in paragraph B4."
1050_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,"Bio-effluents, as described in paragraph B6."
1051_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,NOTE:
1052_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,The guidance in this approved document may not be adequate to address pollutants from flueless combustion space heaters.
1053_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,This approved document does not address the airborne spread of infection and does not directly address contamination from outdoor sources.
1054_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,NOTE:
1055_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,A strategy for achieving good indoor air quality includes reducing the release of water vapour and air pollutants.
1056_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,This approved document does not provide guidance on such strategies.
1057_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,Performance criteria for dwellings
1058_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,The performance criterion for moisture is that there should be no visible mould on the inner surfaces of the external walls of a properly heated dwelling with typical moisture generation.
1059_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,"Mould can grow whether the dwelling is occupied or unoccupied, so the performance criterion for humidity (given in Table B3) should be met at all times, regardless of whether there are occupants."
1060_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,The other pollutants listed in Table B1 are only of concern when the dwelling is occupied.
1061_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,NOTE:
1062_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,The moisture criteria to avoid house dust mite allergens are more complex and demanding than those to avoid mould.
1063_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,This approved document does not give guidance on the control of house dust mite allergens.
1064_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,The performance criteria for indoor air pollutants are given in Table B1.
1065_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,These are based on the World Health Organization’s Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Selected Pollutants (2010) and Public Health England’s Indoor Air Quality Guidelines for Selected Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the UK (2019).

1098_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,The simplified metric is used as an indicator for the purpose of ventilation control strategies.
1099_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,"As an alternative to the TVOC limit, individual VOC limits may be used where justified in accordance with the guidance in paragraph B5."
1100_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,"As an alternative to using TVOC, the individual VOCs may be applied where their use is supported by robust independent evidence."
1101_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,Public Health England’s Indoor Air Quality Guidelines for Selected Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the UK should be used.
1102_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,Testing against these metrics is likely to be more complex than testing against TVOC.
1103_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V1,Control of bio-effluents (body odours) for people who have been exposed to the environment for a period of time will be achieved by an air supply rate of 4 litres per second per person (BS EN 16798-1).
