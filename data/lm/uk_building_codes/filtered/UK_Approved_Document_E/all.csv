224_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Grouping
225_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The results of tests only apply to the particular constructions tested but are indicative of the performance of others of the same type in the same development.
226_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Therefore, in order for meaningful inferences to be made from tests, it is essential that developments are considered as a number of notional groups, with the same construction type within each group."
227_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Grouping should be carried out according to the following criteria.
228_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Dwelling-houses (including bungalows), flats and rooms for residential purposes should be considered as three separate groups."
229_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In addition, if significant differences in construction type occur within any of these groups, sub-groups should be established accordingly."
230_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The following guidance should allow suitable sub-grouping in most circumstances.
231_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Sub-grouping for new buildings
232_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For dwelling-houses (including bungalows), sub-grouping should be by type of separating wall."
233_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For flats, sub-grouping should be by type of separating floor and type of separating wall."
234_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Rooms for residential purposes should be grouped using similar principles.
235_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The construction of flanking elements (e.g. walls, floors, cavities) and their junctions are also important."
236_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where there are significant differences between flanking details, further sub-grouping will be necessary."
237_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Sub-grouping may not be necessary for dwelling-houses, flats and rooms for residential purposes that have the same separating wall and/or separating floor construction, with the same associated flanking construction(s), and where the room dimensions and layouts are broadly similar."
238_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Some dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes may be considered to have unfavourable features: an example could be flats with large areas of flanking wall without a window at the gable end."
239_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,It would be inappropriate for these to be included as part of a group and these should form their own sub-group(s).
240_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Introduction
241_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"This section provides guidance on an appropriate programme of sound insulation testing for a sample of properties, under Regulation 41 of the Building Regulations and Regulation 20(1) and (5) of the Approved Inspectors Regulations."
242_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Sound insulation testing to demonstrate 1.2 compliance with Requirement E1 should be carried out on site as part of the construction process, and in this Approved Document it is referred to as pre-completion testing."
243_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Under Regulation 41 and Regulation 20(1) and (5), the duty of ensuring that appropriate sound insulation testing is carried out falls on the person carrying out the building work, who is also responsible for the cost of the testing."
244_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Therefore, the guidance in this section is addressed in the first place to persons carrying out the work (and to testing bodies employed by them)."
245_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, it is also addressed to building control bodies, as the Secretary of State expects building control bodies to determine, for each relevant development, the properties selected for testing."
246_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Testing should be carried out for:
247_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,purpose built dwelling-houses and flats;
248_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,dwelling-houses and flats formed by material change of use;
249_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,purpose built rooms for residential purposes;
250_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,rooms for residential purposes formed by material change of use.
251_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The normal programme of testing is 1.4 described in paragraphs 1.29 to 1.31.
252_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The testing procedure formally approved by the Secretary of State is described in Annex B: Procedures for sound insulation testing.
253_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The performance standards that should be 1.6 demonstrated by pre-completion testing are set out in Section 0: Performance – Tables 1a and 1b.
254_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The sound insulation values in these tables have a built-in allowance for measurement uncertainty, so if any test shows one of these values not to have been achieved by any margin, the test has been failed."
255_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The person carrying out the building work should ensure that the guidance on construction given in this Approved Document, or in another suitable source, is followed properly to minimise the chances of a failed test."
256_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where additional guidance is required, specialist advice on the building design should be sought at an early stage."
257_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Testing should not be carried out between living spaces and: corridors, stairwells or hallways."
258_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Tests should be carried out between rooms 1.9 or spaces that share a common area of separating wall or separating floor.
259_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,16
260_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Resistance to the passage of sound Approved Document EONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION PRE-COMPLETION TESTING Sub-grouping for material change of use
261_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The same principles as for new buildings apply, but in practice significant differences are more likely to occur between separating wall and/or separating floor constructions as well as the associated flanking construction(s) in a development."
262_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"More sub-groups may therefore be required, and group sizes may be smaller."
263_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Building control bodies should exercise judgement when setting up sub-groups.
264_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Sets of tests in dwelling-houses (including bungalows)
265_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Normally, one set of tests should comprise two individual sound insulation tests (two airborne tests):"
266_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,• A test of insulation against airborne sound between one pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as living rooms) on opposite sides of the separating wall.
267_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,• A test of insulation against airborne sound between another pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as bedrooms) on opposite sides of the separating wall.
268_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Sets of tests in flats with separating floors but without separating walls
269_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Normally, one set of tests should comprise four individual sound insulation tests (two airborne tests, two impact tests):"
270_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,• Tests of insulation against both airborne and impact sound between one pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as living rooms) on opposite sides of the separating floor.
271_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,• Tests of insulation against both airborne and impact sound between another pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as bedrooms) on opposite sides of the separating floor.
272_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Sets of tests in flats with a separating floor and a separating wall
273_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Normally, one set of tests should comprise six individual sound insulation tests (four airborne tests, two impact tests):"
274_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,• A test of insulation against airborne sound between one pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as living rooms) on opposite sides of the separating wall.
275_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,• A test of insulation against airborne sound between another pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as bedrooms) on opposite sides of the separating wall.
276_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,• Tests of insulation against both airborne and impact sound between one pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as living rooms) on opposite sides of the separating floor.
277_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,E
278_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,• Tests of insulation against both airborne and impact sound between another pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as bedrooms) on opposite sides of the separating floor.
279_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"To conduct a full set of tests, access to at least three flats will be required."
280_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Types of rooms for testing
281_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,individual tests in bedrooms and living rooms.
282_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"It is preferable that each set of tests contains 1.24 Where pairs of rooms on either side of the separating element are different (e.g. a bedroom and a study, a living room and a bedroom), at least one of the rooms in one of the pairs should be a bedroom and at least one of the rooms in the other pair should be a living room."
283_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where the layout has only one pair of rooms on opposite sides of the entire area of separating wall or floor between two dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes then the number of airborne and impact sound insulation tests set out in paragraphs 1.19 to 1.21 may be reduced accordingly."
284_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The approved procedure described in Annex B includes requirements relating to rooms.
285_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Sets of tests in rooms for residential purposes
286_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"To conduct a set of tests, the sound insulation between the main rooms should be measured according to the principles set out in this section for new buildings and material change of use, but adapting them to suit the circumstances."
287_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Properties sold before fitting out
288_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Some properties, for example loft apartments, may be sold before being fitted out with internal walls and other fixtures and fittings."
289_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Measurements of sound insulation should be made between the available spaces, according to the principles set out in this section."
290_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Steps should be taken to ensure that fitting out will not adversely affect the sound insulation.
291_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Some guidance on internal wall and floor constructions is given in Section 5. Junction details between these internal walls and floors and separating walls and floors are described in Sections 2 and 3.
292_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Normal programme of testing
293_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Building control bodies should consult with developers on likely completion times on site, and ask for one set of tests to be carried out between the first dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes scheduled for completion and/or sale in each group or sub-group."
294_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,This applies regardless of the intended size of the group or sub-group.
295_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Therefore if a site comprises only one pair of dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes, they should be tested."

297_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Approved Document E Resistance to the passage of soundONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION E PRE-COMPLETION TESTING
298_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"As further properties on a development become ready for testing, building control bodies should indicate at what point(s) they wish any further set(s) of tests to be conducted."
299_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Assuming no tests are failed, building control bodies should stipulate at least one set of tests for every ten dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes in a group or sub-group."
300_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Testing should be conducted more frequently at the beginning of a series of completions than towards the end, to allow any potential problems to be addressed at an early stage."
301_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, on large developments testing should be carried out over a substantial part of the construction period."
302_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Action following a failed set of tests
303_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,A set of tests is failed if any of its individual tests of airborne or impact sound insulation do not show sound insulation values equal to or better than those set out in Section 0: Performance – Tables 1a and 1b.
304_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In the event of a failed set of tests, appropriate remedial treatment should be applied to the rooms that failed the test."
305_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"A failed set of tests raises questions over the sound insulation between other rooms sharing the same separating element in the dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes in which the tests were conducted."
306_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The developer should demonstrate to the building control body’s satisfaction that these rooms meet the performance standards.
307_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Normally this would be done by (a) additional testing, and/or (b) applying the appropriate remedial treatment to the other rooms and/or (c) demonstrating that the cause of failure does not occur in other rooms."
308_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,A failed set of tests raises questions over properties between which tests have not been carried out.
309_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The developer should demonstrate to the building control body’s satisfaction that such properties meet the performance standards.
310_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Once a dwelling-house, flat or room for residential purposes is occupied, any action affecting it should be a matter for local negotiation."
311_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"After a failed set of tests, the rate of testing should be increased until the building control body is satisfied that the problem has been solved."
312_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Remedial treatment
313_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Appropriate remedial treatment should be applied following a failed set of tests.
314_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,It is essential that remedial work is appropriate to the cause of failure.
315_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Guidance is available in BRE Information Paper IP 14/02.
316_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where the cause of failure is attributed to the construction of the separating and/or associated flanking elements, other rooms that have not been tested may also fail to meet the performance standards."
317_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Therefore, remedial treatment may be needed in rooms other than those in which the tests were conducted."
318_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where remedial treatment has been applied, the building control body should be satisfied with its efficacy."
319_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Normally this will be assessed through additional sound insulation testing.
320_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Material change of use
321_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"As stated in Section 0, in the case of some historic buildings undergoing a material change of use, it may not always be practical to achieve the sound insulation values set out in Section 0: Performance – Tables 1a and 1b."
322_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, in such cases building control bodies should be satisfied that everything reasonable has been done to improve the sound insulation."
323_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Tests should be carried out, and the results displayed as indicated in Section 0, paragraph 0.7."
324_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,In order to satisfy the requirements of Approved manner of recording pre-completion testing results
325_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"paragraph (3)(a) of Regulation 41 or Regulation 20(1) and (5), the test report of a set of tests (where set of tests has the meaning given in paragraphs 1.19–1.21 and 1.27) must contain at least the following information, in the order below:"

359_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The walls are grouped into four main types.
360_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,See Diagram 2.1.
361_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Wall type 1: Solid masonry The resistance to airborne sound depends mainly on the mass per unit area of the wall.
362_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Wall type 2: Cavity masonry The resistance to airborne sound depends on the mass per unit area of the leaves and on the degree of isolation achieved.
363_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The isolation is affected by connections (such as wall ties and foundations) between the wall leaves and by the cavity width.
364_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Wall type 3: Masonry between independent panels The resistance to airborne sound depends partly on the type and mass per unit area of the core, and partly on the isolation and mass per unit area of the independent panels."
365_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Wall type 4: Framed walls with absorbent material The resistance to airborne sound depends on the mass per unit area of the leaves, the isolation of the frames, and the absorption in the cavity between the frames."
366_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Within each wall type the constructions are ranked, as far as possible, with constructions providing higher sound insulation given first."
367_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,In order for the construction to be fully Junctions between separating walls and other building elements

409_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Mass per unit area of walls
410_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The mass per unit area of a wall is expressed in kilograms per square metre (kg/m2).

1537_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,This Section gives guidance on dwelling-
1538_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,houses and flats formed by material change of use.
1539_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,For rooms for residential purposes formed by material change of use see Section 6.
1540_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"It may be that an existing wall, floor or stair 4.2 in a building that is to undergo a material change of use will achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a without the need for remedial work."
1541_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"This would be the case if the construction was generally similar (including flanking constructions) to one of the constructions in Sections 2 and 3 (e.g. concerning the mass requirement, the structure under consideration should be within 15% of the mass per unit area of a construction listed in the relevant section)."
1542_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,In other circumstances it may be possible 4.3 to use the guidance in Section 2 or 3 (including flanking constructions) to determine the appropriate remedial treatment which will result in the construction achieving the performance standards in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a.
1543_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For situations where it is uncertain whether 4.4 the existing construction achieves the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a, this section describes one wall treatment, two floor treatments and one stair treatment as shown in Diagram 4.1."
1544_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,These constructions can be used to increase the sound insulation.
1545_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The guidance in this section is not exhaustive and other designs, materials or products may be used to achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a. Advice should be sought from the manufacturer or other appropriate source."

1555_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Work to existing construction
1556_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Before a floor treatment is applied appropriate remedial work to the existing construction should be undertaken as described in paragraphs 4.17 and 4.18.
1557_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,If the existing floor is timber then gaps in 4.17 floor boarding should be sealed by overlaying with hardboard or filled with sealant.
1558_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where floor boards are to be replaced, boarding should have a minimum thickness of 12mm, and mineral wool (minimum thickness 100mm, minimum density 10kg/m³) should be laid between the joists in the floor cavity."
1559_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"If the existing floor is concrete and the mass per unit area of the concrete floor is less than 300kg/m², or is unknown, then the mass of the floor should be increased to at least 300kg/m²."
1560_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Any air gaps through a concrete floor should be sealed.
1561_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,A regulating screed may also be required.
1562_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,If there is an existing lath and plaster ceiling it should be retained as long as it satisfies Building Regulation Part B – Fire safety.
1563_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where the existing ceiling is not lath and plaster it should be upgraded as necessary to provide at least two layers of plasterboard with joints staggered, total mass per unit area 20kg/m²."
1564_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Extensive remedial work to reduce flanking transmission may also be necessary to achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a.
1565_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"This may involve wall linings, see Section 4: Junction requirements for material change of use, paragraphs 4.43 and 4.44."
1566_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Corridor walls and doors
1567_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The separating walls described in this section should be used between dwelling-houses, or flats formed by material change of use, and corridors in order to control flanking transmission and to provide the required sound insulation."
1568_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, it is likely that the sound insulation will be reduced by the presence of a door."
1569_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Ensure that any door has good perimeter sealing (including the threshold where practical) and a minimum mass per unit area of 25kg/m² or a minimum sound reduction index of 29dB Rw (measured according to BS EN ISO 140-3:1995 and rated according to BS EN ISO 717-1:1997).
1570_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The door should also satisfy the Requirements of Building Regulation Part B – Fire safety.
1571_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Noisy parts of the building should preferably have a lobby, double door or high performance doorset to contain the noise."
1572_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where this is not possible, nearby flats should have similar protection."
1573_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, there should be a sufficient number of them that are suitable for disabled access, see Building Regulations Part M – Access and facilities for disabled people."

1800_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The guidance in this section is not 6.3 exhaustive and other designs, materials or products may be used to achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1b."
1801_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Advice should be sought from the manufacturer or other appropriate source.
1802_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Separating walls in new buildings containing rooms for residential purposes
1803_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Of the separating walls described in Section 2 the following types are most suitable for use in new buildings containing rooms for residential purposes:
1804_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Wall type 1.

1814_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Specialist advice may be needed.
1815_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Corridor walls and doors
1816_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Separating walls described in 6.4 should be used between rooms for residential purposes and corridors in order to control flanking transmission and to provide the required sound insulation between the dwelling and the corridor.

1862_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Introduction
1863_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"This Section describes how to determine the amount of additional absorption to be used in corridors, hallways, stairwells and entrance halls that give access to flats and rooms for residential purposes."
1864_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For the purposes of this Section, a corridor 7.2 or hallway is a space for which the ratio of the longest to the shortest floor dimension is greater than three."
1865_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For the purposes of this Section, an entrance 7.3 hall is a space for which the ratio of the longest to the shortest floor dimension is three or less."
1866_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"When an entrance hall, corridor, hallway or stairwell opens directly into another of these spaces, the guidance should be followed for each space individually."
1867_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The choice of absorptive material should 7.5 meet the Requirements of Building Regulation Part B – Fire safety.
1868_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Two methods are described to satisfy 7.6 Requirement E3, Method A and Method B."
1869_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Method A: Cover a specified area with an absorber of an appropriate class that has been rated according to BS EN ISO 11654:1997 Acoustics.
1870_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Sound absorbers for use in buildings.
1871_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Rating of sound absorption.
1872_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Method B: Determine the minimum amount of absorptive material using a calculation procedure in octave bands.
1873_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Method B is intended only for corridors, hallways and entrance halls as it is not well suited to stairwells."
1874_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where additional guidance is required, specialist advice should be sought at an early stage"
1875_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Method A
1876_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For entrance halls, corridors or hallways, cover an area equal to or greater than the floor area, with a Class C absorber or better."
1877_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,It will normally be convenient to cover the ceiling area with the additional absorption.
1878_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For stairwells or a stair enclosure, calculate the combined area of the stair treads, the upper surface of the intermediate landings, the upper surface of the landings (excluding ground floor) and the ceiling area on the top floor."
1879_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Either cover at least an area equal to this calculated area with a Class D absorber, or cover an area equal to at least 50% of this calculated area with a Class C absorber or better."
1880_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The absorptive material should be equally distributed between all floor levels.
1881_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"It will normally be convenient to cover the underside of intermediate landings, the underside of the other landings, and the ceiling area on the top floor."
1882_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Method A can generally be satisfied by the use of proprietary acoustic ceilings.
1883_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, the absorptive material can be applied to any surface that faces into the space."
1884_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In comparison with Method A, Method B Method B"
1885_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,takes account of the existing absorption provided by all surfaces.
1886_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In some cases, Method B should allow greater flexibility in meeting Requirement E3 and require less additional absorption than Method A."
1887_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For an absorptive material of surface area, S in m², and sound absorption coefficient, α the absorption area A is equal to the product of S and α."
1888_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The total absorption area, AT, in square metres is defined as the hypothetical area of a totally absorbing surface, which if it were the only absorbing element in the space would give the same reverberation time as the space under consideration."
1889_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For n surfaces in a space, the total absorption area, AT, can be found using the following equation."
1890_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For entrance halls, provide a minimum of 0.20m² total absorption area per cubic metre of the volume."
1891_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The additional absorptive material should be distributed over the available surfaces.
1892_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For corridors or hallways, provide a minimum of 0.25m² total absorption area per cubic metre of the volume."
1893_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The additional absorptive material should be distributed over one or more of the surfaces.
1894_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Absorption areas should be calculated for each octave band.
1895_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Requirement E3 will be satisfied when the appropriate amount of absorption area is provided for each octave band between 250Hz and 4000Hz inclusively.
1896_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Absorption coefficient data (to two decimal places) should be taken from the following:
1897_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"• For specific products, use laboratory measurements of absorption coefficient data determined using BS EN 20354:1993 Acoustics."

2417_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,the notification specifies the unique number or numbers issued by Robust Details Ltd in respect of the specified use of the design detail or details;
2418_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,the building work carried out in respect of the part or parts of the building identified in the notification is in accordance with the design detail or details specified in the notification.
2419_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"If the notification is late, or if it does not specify the relevant part or parts, the design detail or details in question and the unique number or numbers, the part or parts of the building in question are subject to sound insulation testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5) in the usual way."
2420_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"If the notification is itself valid but the work is not carried out in accordance with the design detail or details, the relevant separating structures become subject to sound insulation testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5)."
2421_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,It would be open to the builder to take remedial action such that the building control body was satisfied that the work had been brought into compliance with the specified detail or details.
2422_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"With that exception, testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5) would be needed on all structures that have been subject to a valid notification under Regulation 41(4) or 20(1) and (5) but which in the opinion of the building control body have not then been constructed in accordance with the specified detail or details."
2423_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"It should be noted that the compliance of work with a robust detail, in circumstances where the correct procedures have been followed to attract exemption from PCT, is not a ‘deemed to satisfy’ condition."
2424_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The underlying requirement remains to achieve compliance with Part E1.
2425_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The guidance in Approved Document E is that compliance will usually be established by the measured performance of the structure.
2426_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Therefore it would be open to anyone, e.g. a homeowner, who considered that a party structure does not comply with Part E1, to seek to establish that by the carrying out of tests."
2427_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"It would not be a defence for the builder to show that he had correctly carried out a design detail approved by Robust Details Ltd, if the structure’s measured performance were shown not to meet the performance standards in Approved Document E."
2428_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Robust Details Ltd is a non-profit distributing company, limited by guarantee, set up by the house-building industry."
2429_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Its objectives are broadly to identify, arrange testing and, if satisfied, approve and publish design details that, if correctly implemented in separating structures, should achieve compliance with Requirement E1."
2430_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,It also carries out checks on the performance achieved in practice.
2431_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The robust design details are available in a handbook, which may be purchased from Robust Details Ltd."
2432_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The company can be contacted at: PO Box 7289, Milton Keynes, Bucks, MK14 6ZQ; telephone 0870 240 8210; fax 0870 240 8203; e-mail administration@robustdetails.com; website www.robustdetails.com"
2433_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Although the design details are in the public domain, their use in building work is not authorised unless the builder has registered the particular use of the relevant design detail or details with Robust Details Ltd and obtained a unique number or numbers from the company."
2434_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Each unique number identifies a house or flat in which one or more of the design details are being used.
2435_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The system of unique numbers makes possible an essential part of Robust Details Ltd’s procedures for ensuring that design details it has approved deliver reasonable sound insulation performance in practice.
2436_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Robust Details Ltd carries out a programme of checks on a proportion of cases where approved design details are used.
2437_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Under Regulation 41(4) of the Building Regulations 2010 and Regulation 20(1) of the Building (Approved Inspector, etc.)"
2438_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Regulations 2010, the requirement for appropriate sound insulation testing imposed by Regulations 41 and 20(1) does not apply to parts of the building which would otherwise be subject to the testing requirement where all the following apply:"
2439_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,the building work consists of the erection of a new dwelling-house (i.e. a semi-detached or terraced house) or a building containing flats;
2440_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"the person carrying out the building work notifies the building control body before the start of building work on site that, in a specified part or parts of the building, he is using one or more specified design details from those approved by Robust Details Ltd."
2441_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In a case where building control is being carried out by the local authority, the notification must be given not later than the date on which notice of commencement of construction is given under Regulation 16(1) of the Building Regulations 2010;"
