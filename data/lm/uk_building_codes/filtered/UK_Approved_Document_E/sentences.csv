2_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Any building work which is subject to the requirements imposed by Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations shall be carried out in accordance with regulation 7. Guidance on meeting these requirements on materials and workmanship is contained in Approved Document 7.
3_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Building Regulations are made for specific purposes, primarily the health and safety, welfare and convenience of people and for energy conservation."
4_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Standards and other technical specifications may provide relevant guidance to the extent that they relate to these considerations.
5_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, they may also address other aspects of performance or matters which, although they relate to health and safety etc., are not covered by the Building Regulations."
6_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"When an Approved Document makes reference to a named standard, the relevant version of the standard to which it refers is the one listed at the end of the publication."
7_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, if this version has been revised or updated by the issuing standards body, the new version may be used as a source of guidance provided it continues to address the relevant requirements of the Regulations."
10_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 contain some requirements which affect building design."
11_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The main requirements are now covered by the Building Regulations, but for further information see – Workplace health, safety and welfare."
12_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."
13_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Approved Code of Practice and Guidance, 1998."
15_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 apply to the common parts of flats and similar buildings if people such as cleaners and caretakers are employed to work in these common parts."
16_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where the requirements of the Building Regulations that are covered by this Part do not apply to dwellings, the provisions may still be required in the situations described above in order to satisfy the Workplace Regulations."
19_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"This document is one of a series that has been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of Schedule 1 to, and Regulation 7 of, the Building Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/2214) for England and Wales."
20_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,At the back of this document is a list of all the documents that have been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for this purpose.
21_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Approved Documents are intended to provide guidance for some of the more common building situations.
22_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, there may well be alternative ways of achieving compliance with the requirements."
23_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Thus there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an Approved Document if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way.
25_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The guidance contained in an Approved Document relates only to the particular requirements of the Regulations which the document addresses.
26_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The building work will also have to comply with the requirements of any other relevant paragraphs in Schedule 1 to the Regulations.
27_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,There are Approved Documents which give guidance on each of the parts of Schedule 1 and on Regulation 7.
29_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In accordance with Regulation 8, the requirements in Parts A to D, F to K and N (except for paragraphs H2 and J7) of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations do not require anything to be done except for the purpose of securing reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about buildings (and any others who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings)."
30_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,This is one of the categories of purpose for which building regulations may be made.
31_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Paragraphs H2 and J7 are excluded from Regulation 8 because they deal directly with prevention of the contamination of water.
32_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Parts E and M (which deal, respectively, with resistance to the passage of sound, and access and facilities for disabled people) are excluded from Regulation 8 because they address the welfare and convenience of building users."
33_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Part L is excluded from Regulation 8 because it addresses the conservation of fuel and power.
34_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"All these matters are amongst the purposes, other than health and safety, that may be addressed by Building Regulations."
40_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"This Approved Document, which took effect on 1 July 2003, deals with the Requirements of Part E of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010."

50_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Dwelling-houses, flats and rooms for residential purposes shall be designed and constructed in such a way that:"
51_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"internal walls between a bedroom or a room containing a water closet, and other rooms; and"
53_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,provide reasonable resistance to sound.
55_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The common internal parts of buildings which contain flats or rooms for residential purposes shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent more reverberation around the common parts than is reasonable.
57_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Each room or other space in a school building shall be designed and constructed in such a way that it has the acoustic conditions and the insulation against disturbance by noise appropriate to its intended use.
58_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,For the purposes of this Part – ‘school’ has the same meaning as in Section 4 of the Education Act 1996[4]; and ‘school building’ means any building forming a school or part of a school.
61_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Section 4 was amended by Schedule 22 to the Education Act 1997 (c. 44).
64_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Attention is drawn to the following extracts from the Building Regulations 2010.
65_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Interpretation (Regulation 2) ‘room for residential purposes’ means a room, or a suite of rooms, which is not a dwelling-house or a flat and which is used by one or more persons to live and sleep and includes a room in a hostel, an hotel, a boarding house, a hall of residence or a residential home, but does not include a room in a hospital, or other similar establishment, used for patient accommodation."

145_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,‘Historic buildings’: Historic buildings include:
150_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,vernacular buildings of traditional form and construction.
154_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In the Secretary of State’s view the normal way of satisfying Requirement E1 will be to build separating walls, separating floors, and stairs that have a separating function, together with the associated flanking construction, in such a way that they achieve the sound insulation values for dwelling-houses and flats set out in Table 1a, and the values for rooms for residential purposes (see definition in Regulation 2) set out in Table 1b."
155_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For walls that separate rooms for residential purposes from adjoining dwelling-houses and flats, the performance standards given in Table 1a should be achieved."
157_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Regulations 2010 apply to building work to which Requirement E1 applies, and require appropriate sound insulation testing to be carried out."
158_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The exception is that, in the case of new-build houses and buildings containing flats, Regulations 41 and 20(1) and (5) do not apply to any relevant part of the building where the design embodies a design detail or details from the set approved and published by Robust Details Ltd; a valid notification is given to the building control body; and the actual work complies with the detail or details specified in the notification."
159_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Subject to this exception, which is further explained in Annex E: Design details approved by Robust Details Ltd, Regulation 44 applies where building control is being carried out by a local authority, and Regulation 20(1) and (5) applies where it is being carried out by an Approved Inspector."
160_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The normal way of satisfying Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5) will be to implement a programme of sound insulation testing according to the guidance set out in Section 1: Pre-completion testing, of this Approved Document."
161_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"It is possible for a builder to opt to use design details approved by Robust Details Ltd in some only of the relevant separating structures in a new house or building containing flats, with the other relevant separating structures remaining subject to testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5)."
162_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, it is recommended that expert advice is taken to ensure compatibility of the constructions."
182_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Walls Floors 0.3 The sound insulation testing should be carried out in accordance with the procedure described in Annex B of this Approved Document, which is the procedure formally approved by the Secretary of State for the purpose of paragraph (2)(a) of Regulation 41 and paragraph (2)(a) of Regulation 20(1) and (5)."
183_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The results of the testing must be recorded in the manner described in paragraph 1.41 of Section 1 of this Approved Document, which is the manner approved by the Secretary of State for the purposes of paragraph (3)(a) of Regulation 41 and paragraph (3)(a) of Regulation 20(1) and (5)."
184_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The test results must be given to the building control body in accordance with the time limits set down in Regulation 41 (for cases where building control is being done by the local authority) or Regulation 20(1) and (5) (in cases where it is being done by an Approved Inspector).
185_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The person carrying out the building work should arrange for sound insulation testing to be carried out by a test body with appropriate third party accreditation.
186_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Test bodies conducting testing should preferably have UKAS accreditation (or a European equivalent) for field measurements.
187_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The DCLG also regards members of the ANC Registration Scheme as suitably qualified to carry out pre-completion testing.
188_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Sections 2, 3, 4 and 6 of this Approved 0.5 Document give examples of constructions which, if built correctly, should achieve the sound insulation values for dwelling-houses and flats set out in Table 1a, and the values for rooms for residential purposes set out in Table 1b."
189_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The guidance in these sections is not exhaustive and other designs, materials or products may be used to achieve the required performance."
190_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Buildings constructed from sub-assemblies that are delivered newly made or selected from stock are no different from any other new building and must comply with all requirements in Schedule 1 of the Building Regulations 2010.
191_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In some applications, such as buildings that are constructed to be temporary dwelling-houses, flats, rooms for residential purposes, or school buildings, the provision of reasonable resistance to the passage of sound may vary depending upon the circumstances in the particular case."
195_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"on the same premises would normally be considered to meet the requirements, (b) a building constructed from sub-assemblies obtained from other premises or from stock manufactured before 1 July 2003 would normally be considered to meet the requirements if it satisfies the relevant requirements of Part E that were applicable in 1992 or, for school buildings, the relevant provisions relating to acoustics set out in the 1997 edition of Building Bulletin 87 (ISBN 011271013 1)."
196_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In the case of some historic buildings 0.7 undergoing a material change of use, it may not be practical to improve the sound insulation to the standards set out in Tables 1a and 1b."
197_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The need to conserve the special characteristics of such historic buildings needs to be recognised1, and in such work, the aim should be to improve sound insulation to the extent that it is practically possible, always provided that the work does not prejudice the character of the historic building, or increase the risk of long-term deterioration to the building fabric or fittings."
198_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,In arriving at an appropriate balance between historic building conservation and improving sound insulation it would be appropriate to take into account the advice of the local planning authority’s conservation officer.
199_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In such cases it will be reasonable to improve the sound insulation as much as is practical, and to affix a notice showing the sound insulation value(s) obtained by testing in accordance with Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5), in a conspicuous place inside the building."
200_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The performance standards set out in Tables 0.8 1a and 1b are appropriate for walls, floors and stairs that separate spaces used for normal domestic purposes."
201_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,A higher standard of sound insulation may be required between spaces used for normal domestic purposes and communal or non-domestic purposes.
202_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,In these situations the appropriate level of sound insulation will depend on the noise generated in the communal or non-domestic space.
203_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Specialist advice may be needed to establish if a higher standard of sound insulation is required and, if so, to determine the appropriate level."
204_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"BS 7913 The principles of the conservation of historic buildings, 1998 provides guidance on the principles that should be applied when proposing work on historic buildings."
206_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Approved Document E Resistance to the passage of soundONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 0.12 In the Secretary of State’s view the normal way of satisfying Requirement E4 will be to meet the values for sound insulation, reverberation time and indoor ambient noise which are given in Building Bulletin 93 Acoustic design of schools: performance standards, published by the Department for Education and available on the internet at www.gov.uk."
207_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Diagrams 0.1 to 0.3 illustrate the relevant parts of the building that should be protected from airborne and impact sound in order to satisfy Requirements E1 and E2.
209_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In the Secretary of State’s view the normal 0.9 way of satisfying Requirement E2 will be to use constructions for new walls and floors within a dwelling-house, flat or room for residential purposes (including extensions), that provide the laboratory sound insulation values set out in Table 2. Test bodies conducting testing should preferably have UKAS accreditation (or a European equivalent) for laboratory measurements."
210_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,It is not intended that performance should be verified by testing on site.
211_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Section 5 gives examples of constructions that should achieve the laboratory values set out in Table 2.
212_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The guidance in these sections is not exhaustive and other designs, materials or products may be used to achieve the required performance."
213_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In the Secretary of State’s view the normal 0.11 way of satisfying Requirement E3 will be to apply the sound absorption measures described in Section 7 of this Approved Document, or other measures of similar effectiveness."
221_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Tests should be carried out once the dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes either side of a separating element are essentially complete, except for decoration."
222_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Impact sound insulation tests should be carried out without a soft covering (e.g. carpet, foam backed vinyl) on the floor."
223_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,For exceptions and further information on floor coverings and testing see Annex B: paragraphs B2.13 and B2.14.
225_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The results of tests only apply to the particular constructions tested but are indicative of the performance of others of the same type in the same development.
226_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Therefore, in order for meaningful inferences to be made from tests, it is essential that developments are considered as a number of notional groups, with the same construction type within each group."
227_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Grouping should be carried out according to the following criteria.
228_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Dwelling-houses (including bungalows), flats and rooms for residential purposes should be considered as three separate groups."
229_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In addition, if significant differences in construction type occur within any of these groups, sub-groups should be established accordingly."
230_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The following guidance should allow suitable sub-grouping in most circumstances.
232_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For dwelling-houses (including bungalows), sub-grouping should be by type of separating wall."
233_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"For flats, sub-grouping should be by type of separating floor and type of separating wall."
234_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Rooms for residential purposes should be grouped using similar principles.
235_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The construction of flanking elements (e.g. walls, floors, cavities) and their junctions are also important."
236_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where there are significant differences between flanking details, further sub-grouping will be necessary."
237_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Sub-grouping may not be necessary for dwelling-houses, flats and rooms for residential purposes that have the same separating wall and/or separating floor construction, with the same associated flanking construction(s), and where the room dimensions and layouts are broadly similar."
238_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Some dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes may be considered to have unfavourable features: an example could be flats with large areas of flanking wall without a window at the gable end."
239_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,It would be inappropriate for these to be included as part of a group and these should form their own sub-group(s).
241_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"This section provides guidance on an appropriate programme of sound insulation testing for a sample of properties, under Regulation 41 of the Building Regulations and Regulation 20(1) and (5) of the Approved Inspectors Regulations."
242_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Sound insulation testing to demonstrate 1.2 compliance with Requirement E1 should be carried out on site as part of the construction process, and in this Approved Document it is referred to as pre-completion testing."
243_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Under Regulation 41 and Regulation 20(1) and (5), the duty of ensuring that appropriate sound insulation testing is carried out falls on the person carrying out the building work, who is also responsible for the cost of the testing."
244_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Therefore, the guidance in this section is addressed in the first place to persons carrying out the work (and to testing bodies employed by them)."
245_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, it is also addressed to building control bodies, as the Secretary of State expects building control bodies to determine, for each relevant development, the properties selected for testing."
246_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Testing should be carried out for:
247_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,purpose built dwelling-houses and flats;
248_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,dwelling-houses and flats formed by material change of use;
249_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,purpose built rooms for residential purposes;
250_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,rooms for residential purposes formed by material change of use.
251_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The normal programme of testing is 1.4 described in paragraphs 1.29 to 1.31.
252_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The testing procedure formally approved by the Secretary of State is described in Annex B: Procedures for sound insulation testing.
253_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The performance standards that should be 1.6 demonstrated by pre-completion testing are set out in Section 0: Performance – Tables 1a and 1b.
254_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The sound insulation values in these tables have a built-in allowance for measurement uncertainty, so if any test shows one of these values not to have been achieved by any margin, the test has been failed."
255_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The person carrying out the building work should ensure that the guidance on construction given in this Approved Document, or in another suitable source, is followed properly to minimise the chances of a failed test."
256_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where additional guidance is required, specialist advice on the building design should be sought at an early stage."
257_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Testing should not be carried out between living spaces and: corridors, stairwells or hallways."
258_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Tests should be carried out between rooms 1.9 or spaces that share a common area of separating wall or separating floor.
261_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The same principles as for new buildings apply, but in practice significant differences are more likely to occur between separating wall and/or separating floor constructions as well as the associated flanking construction(s) in a development."
262_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"More sub-groups may therefore be required, and group sizes may be smaller."
263_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Building control bodies should exercise judgement when setting up sub-groups.
265_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Normally, one set of tests should comprise two individual sound insulation tests (two airborne tests):"

283_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where the layout has only one pair of rooms on opposite sides of the entire area of separating wall or floor between two dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes then the number of airborne and impact sound insulation tests set out in paragraphs 1.19 to 1.21 may be reduced accordingly."
284_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The approved procedure described in Annex B includes requirements relating to rooms.
286_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"To conduct a set of tests, the sound insulation between the main rooms should be measured according to the principles set out in this section for new buildings and material change of use, but adapting them to suit the circumstances."
288_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Some properties, for example loft apartments, may be sold before being fitted out with internal walls and other fixtures and fittings."
289_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Measurements of sound insulation should be made between the available spaces, according to the principles set out in this section."
290_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Steps should be taken to ensure that fitting out will not adversely affect the sound insulation.
291_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Some guidance on internal wall and floor constructions is given in Section 5. Junction details between these internal walls and floors and separating walls and floors are described in Sections 2 and 3.
293_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Building control bodies should consult with developers on likely completion times on site, and ask for one set of tests to be carried out between the first dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes scheduled for completion and/or sale in each group or sub-group."
294_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,This applies regardless of the intended size of the group or sub-group.
295_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Therefore if a site comprises only one pair of dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes, they should be tested."
298_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"As further properties on a development become ready for testing, building control bodies should indicate at what point(s) they wish any further set(s) of tests to be conducted."
299_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Assuming no tests are failed, building control bodies should stipulate at least one set of tests for every ten dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes in a group or sub-group."
300_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Testing should be conducted more frequently at the beginning of a series of completions than towards the end, to allow any potential problems to be addressed at an early stage."
301_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, on large developments testing should be carried out over a substantial part of the construction period."
303_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,A set of tests is failed if any of its individual tests of airborne or impact sound insulation do not show sound insulation values equal to or better than those set out in Section 0: Performance – Tables 1a and 1b.
304_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In the event of a failed set of tests, appropriate remedial treatment should be applied to the rooms that failed the test."
305_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"A failed set of tests raises questions over the sound insulation between other rooms sharing the same separating element in the dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes in which the tests were conducted."
306_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The developer should demonstrate to the building control body’s satisfaction that these rooms meet the performance standards.
307_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Normally this would be done by (a) additional testing, and/or (b) applying the appropriate remedial treatment to the other rooms and/or (c) demonstrating that the cause of failure does not occur in other rooms."
308_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,A failed set of tests raises questions over properties between which tests have not been carried out.
309_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The developer should demonstrate to the building control body’s satisfaction that such properties meet the performance standards.
310_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Once a dwelling-house, flat or room for residential purposes is occupied, any action affecting it should be a matter for local negotiation."
311_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"After a failed set of tests, the rate of testing should be increased until the building control body is satisfied that the problem has been solved."
313_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Appropriate remedial treatment should be applied following a failed set of tests.
314_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,It is essential that remedial work is appropriate to the cause of failure.
315_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Guidance is available in BRE Information Paper IP 14/02.
316_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where the cause of failure is attributed to the construction of the separating and/or associated flanking elements, other rooms that have not been tested may also fail to meet the performance standards."
317_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Therefore, remedial treatment may be needed in rooms other than those in which the tests were conducted."
318_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where remedial treatment has been applied, the building control body should be satisfied with its efficacy."
319_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Normally this will be assessed through additional sound insulation testing.
321_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"As stated in Section 0, in the case of some historic buildings undergoing a material change of use, it may not always be practical to achieve the sound insulation values set out in Section 0: Performance – Tables 1a and 1b."

359_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The walls are grouped into four main types.
361_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Wall type 1: Solid masonry The resistance to airborne sound depends mainly on the mass per unit area of the wall.
362_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Wall type 2: Cavity masonry The resistance to airborne sound depends on the mass per unit area of the leaves and on the degree of isolation achieved.
363_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The isolation is affected by connections (such as wall ties and foundations) between the wall leaves and by the cavity width.
364_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Wall type 3: Masonry between independent panels The resistance to airborne sound depends partly on the type and mass per unit area of the core, and partly on the isolation and mass per unit area of the independent panels."
365_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Wall type 4: Framed walls with absorbent material The resistance to airborne sound depends on the mass per unit area of the leaves, the isolation of the frames, and the absorption in the cavity between the frames."
366_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Within each wall type the constructions are ranked, as far as possible, with constructions providing higher sound insulation given first."
368_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"effective, care should be taken to correctly detail the junctions between the separating wall and other elements, such as floors, roofs, external walls and internal walls."

371_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Table 2.1 indicates the inclusion of guidance in this document on the junctions that may occur between each of the four separating wall types and various attached building elements.
399_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,For flats the following may also apply:
402_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Separating floor type 2 – concrete base with ceiling and floating floor
404_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Separating floor type 3 – timber frame base with ceiling and platform floor
408_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Where any building element functions as a separating element (e.g. a ground floor that is also a separating floor for a basement flat) then the separating element requirements should take precedence.
410_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The mass per unit area of a wall is expressed in kilograms per square metre (kg/m2).
411_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The method for calculating mass per unit area is shown in Annex A.
412_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The density of the materials used (and on which the mass per unit area of the wall depends) is expressed in kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m³).
413_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"When calculating the mass per unit area for bricks and blocks use the density at the appropriate moisture content from Table 3.2, CIBSE Guide A (1999)."

450_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Noisy parts of the building should preferably have a lobby, double door or high performance doorset to contain the noise."
451_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Where this is not possible, nearby flats should have similar protection."
452_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"However, there should be a sufficient number of flats that are suitable for disabled access, see Building Regulation Part M – Access and facilities for disabled people."
455_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,A wall separating a habitable room or kitchen and a refuse chute should have a mass per unit area (including any finishes) of at least 1320kg/m².

2417_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,the notification specifies the unique number or numbers issued by Robust Details Ltd in respect of the specified use of the design detail or details;
2418_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,the building work carried out in respect of the part or parts of the building identified in the notification is in accordance with the design detail or details specified in the notification.
2419_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"If the notification is late, or if it does not specify the relevant part or parts, the design detail or details in question and the unique number or numbers, the part or parts of the building in question are subject to sound insulation testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5) in the usual way."
2420_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"If the notification is itself valid but the work is not carried out in accordance with the design detail or details, the relevant separating structures become subject to sound insulation testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5)."
2421_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,It would be open to the builder to take remedial action such that the building control body was satisfied that the work had been brought into compliance with the specified detail or details.
2422_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"With that exception, testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5) would be needed on all structures that have been subject to a valid notification under Regulation 41(4) or 20(1) and (5) but which in the opinion of the building control body have not then been constructed in accordance with the specified detail or details."
2423_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"It should be noted that the compliance of work with a robust detail, in circumstances where the correct procedures have been followed to attract exemption from PCT, is not a ‘deemed to satisfy’ condition."
2424_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The underlying requirement remains to achieve compliance with Part E1.
2425_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The guidance in Approved Document E is that compliance will usually be established by the measured performance of the structure.
2426_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Therefore it would be open to anyone, e.g. a homeowner, who considered that a party structure does not comply with Part E1, to seek to establish that by the carrying out of tests."
2427_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"It would not be a defence for the builder to show that he had correctly carried out a design detail approved by Robust Details Ltd, if the structure’s measured performance were shown not to meet the performance standards in Approved Document E."
2428_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Robust Details Ltd is a non-profit distributing company, limited by guarantee, set up by the house-building industry."
2429_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Its objectives are broadly to identify, arrange testing and, if satisfied, approve and publish design details that, if correctly implemented in separating structures, should achieve compliance with Requirement E1."
2430_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,It also carries out checks on the performance achieved in practice.
2431_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"The robust design details are available in a handbook, which may be purchased from Robust Details Ltd."
2433_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Although the design details are in the public domain, their use in building work is not authorised unless the builder has registered the particular use of the relevant design detail or details with Robust Details Ltd and obtained a unique number or numbers from the company."
2434_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Each unique number identifies a house or flat in which one or more of the design details are being used.
2435_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,The system of unique numbers makes possible an essential part of Robust Details Ltd’s procedures for ensuring that design details it has approved deliver reasonable sound insulation performance in practice.
2436_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,Robust Details Ltd carries out a programme of checks on a proportion of cases where approved design details are used.
2438_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"Regulations 2010, the requirement for appropriate sound insulation testing imposed by Regulations 41 and 20(1) does not apply to parts of the building which would otherwise be subject to the testing requirement where all the following apply:"
2439_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,the building work consists of the erection of a new dwelling-house (i.e. a semi-detached or terraced house) or a building containing flats;
2440_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"the person carrying out the building work notifies the building control body before the start of building work on site that, in a specified part or parts of the building, he is using one or more specified design details from those approved by Robust Details Ltd."
2441_UK_UK_Approved_Document_E,"In a case where building control is being carried out by the local authority, the notification must be given not later than the date on which notice of commencement of construction is given under Regulation 16(1) of the Building Regulations 2010;"
