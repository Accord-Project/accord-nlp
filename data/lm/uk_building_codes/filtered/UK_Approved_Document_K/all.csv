170_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Glazing which is installed in a location where there was none previously as part of the
171_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"erection, extension or material alteration of a building (other than an exempt building), and"
172_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,the replacement of a whole unit (i.e. the frame and glazing) is building work and is subject to
173_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,requirement K4 and K5.2.
174_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,The replacement of glazing whilst retaining an existing frame (e.g. as a repair) is not building
175_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"work, but the supply of the glazing may be subject to consumer protection legislation."
176_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Requirement K1 applies to means of access outside a building only when the access is part of the building (i.e. attached).
177_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"For example, requirement K1 does not apply to steps on land leading to a building, but does apply to entrance steps which are part of the building."
178_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Regarding access routes.
179_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Where access and circulation routes form part of a means of escape for people in case of
180_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"fire, refer to Approved Document B: Fire safety, Volume 1 – Dwellinghouses, and Volume 2 –"
181_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Buildings other than dwellinghouses.

197_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Health and safety regulations such as the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 may impose requirements on employers and those in control of premises used as workplaces in relation to certain physical characteristics of the workplace."
198_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Where such regulations apply there may be confusion as to whether the Building Regulations or health and safety requirements take precedence, as both will apply."
199_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Where an inspector for the purposes of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 has identified a contravention of such health and safety regulations they may seek to serve an improvement notice to secure compliance."
200_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"In such circumstances the inspector is prevented by virtue of section 23(3) of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 from requiring measures which are more onerous than necessary to comply with any requirements of the Building Regulations, unless the specific requirement of health and safety regulations are themselves more onerous."

324_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,[ 1] The maximum pitch for a private stair is 42°.
325_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,[
326_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"2] For dwellings, for external tapered steps and stairs that are part of the building the going of each step should be a minimum of 280mm."
327_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,[
328_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"3] For school buildings, the preferred going is 280mm and rise is 150mm."
329_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,The normal relationship between the dimensions of the rise and going is: twice the rise plus the going (2R + G) equals between 550mm and 700mm.
330_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"For existing buildings the dimensional requirements in Table 1.1 should be followed, unless due to dimensional constraints it is not possible."
331_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Any alternative proposal should be agreed with the relevant building control body and included in an access strategy (refer to Approved Document M).
332_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Stepped gangways in assembly buildings
333_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"The guidance provided in this document covers stairs or ramps that form part of the means of access within an assembly building such as a sports stadium, theatre or cinema."
334_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"However, if steps are part of the gangways to areas for spectators, the gangways may need to be at different pitches to maintain sightlines for spectators – this may affect the main stairs."
335_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Apply all of the following guidance.
336_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Ensure that the maximum pitch for gangways to seating areas for spectators is 35°.
337_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Align the ends of all rows of seats/wheelchair spaces so that the width of the gangway remains the same.
338_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Provide transverse gangways to give access from the side to storey exits (vomitory exits) within the body of a seating layout.
339_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Ensure that transverse gangways and radial gangways in auditoria with tiered seating do not cross.
340_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Offset the connections between transverse gangways and radial gangways so that the flow of people to the exits is smooth.
341_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"In stepped tiers, use the following measurements for each step in the gangway:"
342_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,minimum height: 100mm
343_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,maximum height: 190mm
344_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"If there are two or more rises to each row of seats, make each step an equal height."
345_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"f In a tier that is uninterrupted by cross-gangways, and where the pitch exceeds 25°, use a maximum number of steps of 40."

361_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,For all buildings
362_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Have level treads on steps, ensuring that the rise and going of each step are consistent throughout a flight of steps and are in accordance with Table 1.1."
363_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,For buildings other than dwellings
364_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Use risers that are not open.
365_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,NOTE:
366_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,The benefits of a riser that is not open are as follows.
367_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"It removes the possibility of the front of a foot or a walking aid being caught underneath a tread during ascent, possibly causing a fall."
368_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,It avoids the feeling of insecurity people get when looking through open risers on a stair.
369_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"For steps, apply both of the following guidance."
370_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Make step nosings apparent: use a material that will contrast visually, a minimum of 55mm wide, on both the tread and the riser."
371_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Avoid, if possible, step nosings that protrude over the tread below."
372_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"If the nosing protrudes, ensure that this is by no more than 25mm (see Diagram 1.2)."
373_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"If the soffit beneath a stair is less than 2m above floor level, protect the area beneath a stair with one of the following."
374_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Guarding and low level cane detection.
375_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,A barrier giving the same degree of protection.
376_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,For dwellings
377_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Steps may have open risers if they comply with both of the following guidance.
378_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Overlap treads by a minimum of 16mm.
379_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Construct the steps so that a 100mm diameter sphere cannot pass through the open risers.
380_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,For common access areas in buildings that contain flats
381_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Provide a stair with steps that comply with all of the following guidance.
382_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Make step nosings apparent: use a material that will contrast visually, 50mm to 65mm wide on the tread and 30mm to 55mm on the riser."
383_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Use a suitable tread nosing profile, as shown in Diagram 1.2."

899_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"In the Secretary of State’s view, you can meet requirement K2 if, in order to reduce the risk to the safety of people in and around buildings, you use suitable guarding for the appropriate circumstance."
900_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Unless otherwise set out elsewhere in this document for particular situations, you can achieve this by the following:"
901_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,in dwellings: provide pedestrian guarding that is capable of preventing people from being injured by falling from a height of more than 600mm
902_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"in buildings other than dwellings: provide pedestrian guarding that is capable of preventing people from falling more than the height of two risers (or 380mm, if not part of a stair)."
903_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,The standard of provision for guarding needed to give an acceptable level of safety depends on the circumstances.
904_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"For example, in a public building the standard of provision may need to be higher than in a dwelling, because people may be less familiar with the building and there may be more users."
905_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"For areas where access is required only for maintenance, greater care can be expected from people and therefore a lower standard of provision may be acceptable."
