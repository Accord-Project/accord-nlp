35_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,It is work that will be self-certified by a registered competent person or certified by a registered third party.
36_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"It is work exempted from the need to notify by regulation 12(6A) of, or Schedule 4 to, the Building Regulations."
38_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"People who are responsible for building work (e.g. agent, designer, builder or installer) must ensure that the work complies with all applicable requirements of the Building Regulations."
39_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,The building owner may also be responsible for ensuring that work complies with the Building Regulations.
40_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"If building work does not comply with the Building Regulations, the building owner may be served with an enforcement notice."

173_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,requirement K4 and K5.2.
175_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"work, but the supply of the glazing may be subject to consumer protection legislation."
176_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Requirement K1 applies to means of access outside a building only when the access is part of the building (i.e. attached).
177_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"For example, requirement K1 does not apply to steps on land leading to a building, but does apply to entrance steps which are part of the building."
178_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Regarding access routes.
181_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Buildings other than dwellinghouses.
186_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,The guidance provided in this document is in relation to the permanent features which form part of the building providing reasonable safety in the appropriate circumstances.
187_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"However, there may well be particular situations, such as access for maintenance required less frequently than once a month (e.g. see paragraph 1.42b), where such permanent features may be less appropriate."
196_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"this may be the case the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 provides detail on procedures for safe use of temporary means of access, together with focus on effective planning and management of risk."
197_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Health and safety regulations such as the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 may impose requirements on employers and those in control of premises used as workplaces in relation to certain physical characteristics of the workplace."

201_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Where applicable the following cross-referencing should be made.
202_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"For building work relating to requirement K1 of the Building Regulations, regarding the design of stairs, ladders and ramps, see regulation 17 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."

222_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,This approved document deals with the following requirement from Part K of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
226_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Stairs, ladders and ramps shall be so designed, constructed and installed as to be safe for people moving between different levels in or about the building."
227_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Requirement K1 applies only to stairs, ladders and ramps which form part of the building."
229_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"In the Secretary of State’s view, you can meet requirement K1 by ensuring that the steepness, rise and going, handrails, headroom, length and width of any stairs, ladders and ramps between levels are appropriate to afford reasonable safety to people gaining access to and moving about buildings."
230_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,The standard of provision needed to give an acceptable level of safety for access and use depends on the circumstances.
231_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"The standard of provision may need to be higher in a public building than in a dwelling, because people may not be familiar with the building and there may be more users."
232_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"A lower standard of provision may be acceptable where access is required only for maintenance, because greater care can be expected from the people requiring to gain access."
245_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,The guidance provided in this document covers internal and external steps and stairs when they are part of the building.
246_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Additional guidance is provided in Approved Document M when external stepped access also forms part of the principal entrances and alternative accessible entrances, and when they form part of the access route to the building from the boundary of the site and car parking."

324_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,[ 1] The maximum pitch for a private stair is 42°.
326_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"2] For dwellings, for external tapered steps and stairs that are part of the building the going of each step should be a minimum of 280mm."
328_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"3] For school buildings, the preferred going is 280mm and rise is 150mm."
329_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,The normal relationship between the dimensions of the rise and going is: twice the rise plus the going (2R + G) equals between 550mm and 700mm.
330_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"For existing buildings the dimensional requirements in Table 1.1 should be followed, unless due to dimensional constraints it is not possible."
331_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,Any alternative proposal should be agreed with the relevant building control body and included in an access strategy (refer to Approved Document M).
333_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"The guidance provided in this document covers stairs or ramps that form part of the means of access within an assembly building such as a sports stadium, theatre or cinema."
334_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"However, if steps are part of the gangways to areas for spectators, the gangways may need to be at different pitches to maintain sightlines for spectators – this may affect the main stairs."

344_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"If there are two or more rises to each row of seats, make each step an equal height."
345_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"f In a tier that is uninterrupted by cross-gangways, and where the pitch exceeds 25°, use a maximum number of steps of 40."
356_UK_UK_Approved_Document_K,"Where an exit is approached from a stepped gangway, place a landing the width of the exit and a minimum of 1100mm deep immediately in front of the exit doors."
