1_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"This Approved Document, which takes effect on 1 October 2010, deals with combustion appliances and fuel storage systems in the Building Regulations 2010 (as amended)."
2_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Limitation on requirements In accordance with regulation 8 of the Building Regulations, the requirements in Parts A to D, F to K and N and P (except for paragraphs G2, H2 and J6) of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations do not require anything to be done except for the purpose of securing reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about buildings (and any others who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings)."
3_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Paragraph G2 is excluded from regulation 8 as it deals with the conservation of water.
4_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Paragraphs H2 and J6 are excluded from regulation 8 because they deal directly with prevention of the contamination of water and of oil pollution.
5_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Parts E and M (which deal, respectively, with resistance to the passage of sound and access to and use of buildings) are excluded from regulation 8 because they address the welfare and convenience of building users."
6_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Part L is excluded from regulation 8 because it addresses the conservation of fuel and power.
7_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"All these matters are amongst the purposes, other than health and safety that may be addressed by Building Regulations."
10_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Building work, as defined in regulation 3 of the Building Regulations 2010, includes the erection and extension of a building, the provision or extension of a controlled service or fitting, and the material alteration of a building or a controlled service or fitting."
11_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In addition, Building Regulations may apply in cases where the purposes for which or the manner or circumstances in which a building or part of a building is used change in the way that constitutes a material change of use."
12_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Under regulation 4 of the Building Regulations 2010 (as amended), building work should be carried out in such a way that, on completion of work,"
13_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"the building complies with the applicable Parts of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations,"
14_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"in the case of an extension or material alteration of a building, or the provision, extension or material alteration of a controlled service or fitting, where it did not comply with any such requirement, it is no more unsatisfactory in relation to that requirement than before the work was carried out."
15_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Work described in Part J concerns the provision or extension of controlled services or fittings.
16_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Work associated with installations covered in these sections may be subject to other relevant Parts of the Building Regulations.
17_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Material change of use A material change of use occurs in specified circumstances in which a building or part of a building that was previously used for one purpose will be used in future for another.
18_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Where there is a material change of use the Building Regulations set requirements that must be met before the building can be used for its new purpose.
19_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Regulation 5 of the Building Regulations specifies the following circumstances as material changes of use:
20_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building is used as a dwelling where previously it was not.
21_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building contains a flat where previously it did not.
22_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building is used as an hotel or boarding house where previously it was not.
23_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building is used as an institution where previously it was not.
24_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building is used as a public building where previously it was not.
25_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building no longer comes within the exemptions in Schedule 2 to the Building Regulations where previously it did.
26_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building which contains at least one dwelling contains a greater or lesser number of dwellings than it did previously.
27_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building contains a room for residential purposes where previously it did not.
28_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building which contains at least one room for residential puposes contains a greater or lesser number of such rooms than it did previously.
29_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building is used as a shop where previously it was not.
30_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Parts J1 to J4 will apply to all the material changes of use mentioned above which means that whenever such changes occur the building must be brought up to the standards required by Parts J1 to J4.
32_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Buildings included in the schedule of monuments maintained under section 1 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 are exempt from compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.
35_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,There are other classes of buildings where special consideration may be needed in deciding what is adequate provision for compliance with Part J:
37_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,buildings situated in designated conservation areas;
38_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,buildings which are of architectural or historic interest and which are referred to as a material consideration in a local authority’s development plan; and
39_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"buildings of architectural and historical interest within national parks, areas of outstanding or natural beauty and world heritage sites."
40_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It would not normally be considered appropriate to relax the requirements of Part J since they relate to health and safety.
41_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, it may be necessary to seek alternative technical solutions to those set out in this approved document in order to achieve reasonable standards of safety without prejudicing the character of the host building or increasing the risk of long-term deterioration of the building’s fabric or fittings."
42_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In determining what is appropriate in the circumstances, the advice of the local authority’s conservation officer should be sought."
43_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The views of the conservation officer are particularly important where building work requires planning permission and/or listed building consent.
45_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,In almost all cases of new building work it will be necessary to notify a Building Control Body (BCB) in advance of any work starting.
46_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"There are two exceptions to this: where work is carried out under a self-certification scheme listed in Schedule 3, and where work is listed in Schedule 4 to the Building Regulations as being not notifiable."
48_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Under regulation 12(6) of the Building Regulations it is not necessary to notify a BCB in advance of work which is covered by this Approved Document if that work is of a type set out in column 1 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations and is carried out by a person registered with a relevant self-certification (competent persons) scheme as set out in column 2 of that Schedule.
49_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In order to join such a scheme a person must demonstrate competence to carry out the type of work the scheme covers, and also the ability to comply with all relevant requirements in the Building Regulations."
50_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,There are a number of schemes authorised for the installation of combustion appliances.

54_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Full details of the schemes can be found on the individual scheme websites.
56_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Regulations 2010 require that the occupier of the building be given, within 30 days of the completion of the work, a certificate confirming that the work complies with all applicable Building Regulation requirements."
57_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"There is a also requirement that the BCB be given a notice that this has been done, or a copy of the certificate, again within 30 days of the completion of the work."
58_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,These certificates and notices are usually made available through the scheme operator.
59_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,BCBs are authorised to accept these certificates as evidence of compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.
60_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, local authority inspection and enforcement powers remain unaffected, although they are normally used only in response to a complaint that work does not comply."
62_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Schedule 4 to the Building Regulations sets out types of work where there is no requirement to notify a BCB that work is to be carried out.
63_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"These types of work are mainly of a minor nature where there is no significant risk to health, safety, water efficiency or energy efficiency."
64_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Health, safety, and energy efficiency requirements continue to apply to these types of work; only the need to notify a BCB has been removed."
65_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where only non-notifiable work as set out in Schedule 4 is carried out, there is no requirement for a certificate confirming that the work complies with Building Regulation requirements to be given to the occupier or the BCB."
66_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In general, all work on a combustion appliance which is not a repair or maintenance will be notifiable work and Schedule 4 will not apply."
67_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, it might be possible to add a control device to the appliance or to alter its electrical connection under the allowance in this schedule."
68_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Local authority building control departments can give advice in cases of doubt.
70_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Schedule 2 to the Building Regulations sets out a number of classes of buildings which are exempt from all Building Regulations requirements, including those in Part J."

157_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The following definitions have been 1.
158_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,An appliance compartment is an enclosure specifically constructed or adapted to accommodate one or more combustion appliances.
160_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A balanced compartment is a method of installing an open-flued appliance into a compartment which is sealed from the remainder of the building and whose ventilation is so arranged in conjunction with the appliance flue as to achieve a balanced flue effect.
162_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"sealed appliance which draws its combustion air from a point outside the building adjacent to the point at which the combustion products are discharged, the inlet and outlet being so disposed that wind effects are substantially balanced."
163_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Balanced flues may run vertically, but in the most common configuration they discharge horizontally through the external wall against which the appliance is situated."
164_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The boundary is the boundary of the land or buildings belonging to and under the control of the building owner.
165_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Depending upon the paragraphs of this Approved Document to which it applies, it may be drawn only around the perimeter of the land in question or extended to the centreline of adjacent routes or waterways as shown in Diagram 1."
167_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A Building Control Body is a body that carries out checks for compliance with the Building Regulations on plans of building work and on the building work itself.

186_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A draught break is an opening formed by a factory-made component into any part of the flue serving an open-flued appliance.
187_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Such openings may be provided to allow dilution air to be drawn into a flue or to lessen the effects of down-draught on combustion in the appliance.
188_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A draught diverter is a form of draught break intended to prevent conditions in the main length of flue from interfering with the combustion performance of an open-flued appliance (see Diagram 3(a)).
190_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,draughts that may occur in adverse wind conditions and excessive draught.
192_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A draught stabiliser is a factory-made counter-balanced flap device admitting air to the flue, from the same space as the combustion air, to prevent excessive variations in the draught (see Diagram 3(b))."
193_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"It is usual for these to be in the fluepipe or chimney, but they may be located on the appliance."
197_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,as the area of a sharp-edged circular orifice which would pass the same air flow rate at the same applied pressure difference as the product or device being tested.
198_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The equivalent area of a simple ventilator will be less than the geometrical free area and for complex products may be significantly less.
201_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,They are available in various materials and types ranging from single-walled metal chimneys suitable for some gas appliances to twin-walled chimneys with insulation sandwiched between an inner liner and an outer metal wall which are designed for oil or solid fuel use.
202_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In a fanned draught installation, the proper discharge of the flue gases depends upon the operation of a fan, which may be separately installed in the flue or may be an integral part of the combustion appliance."
203_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Fans in combustion appliances either may extract flue gases from the combustion chamber or may cause the flue gases to be displaced from the combustion chamber if the fan is supplying it with air for combustion.
205_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,fired boilers) are also commonly referred to as forced draught appliances (see Diagram 4).
206_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Flues in fanned draught installations run horizontally or vertically and can be at higher or lower pressures than their surroundings, dependent upon the location of the fan."
207_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A fire compartment is a building or part of a building comprising one or more rooms, spaces or storeys constructed to prevent the spread of fire to or from another part of the same building or an adjoining building."

210_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Such walls run the full height of the part and are in one vertical plane.
211_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Further information on this is given in Approved Document B Vol 2 (see Section 8 Compartmentation and Appendix C Methods of Measurement).
212_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A fireplace recess is a structural opening (sometimes called a builder’s opening) formed in a wall or in a chimney breast, from which a chimney leads and which has a hearth at its base."
213_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Simple structural openings (Diagram 5(a)) are suitable for closed appliances such as stoves, cookers or boilers, but gathers (Diagram 5(b)) are necessary for accommodating open fires."
214_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Fireplace recesses are often lined with firebacks to accommodate inset open fires (Diagram 5(c)).
215_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Lining components and decorative treatments fitted around openings reduce the opening area.
216_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It is the finished fireplace opening area which determines the size of flue required for an open fire in such a recess.
217_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The fire resistance of a component or construction is a measure of its ability to withstand the effects of fire in one or more ways for a stated period of time.
218_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Guidance on determination of performance in terms of fire resistance is given in Approved Document B (Fire Safety).
220_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A fire wall is a means of shielding a fuel tank from the thermal radiation from a fire.
221_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For LPG tanks, it also ensures that gas accidentally leaking from the tank or fittings must travel by a longer path and therefore disperse safely, before reaching a hazard such as an opening in a building, a boundary or other potential ignition source."
222_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A flue is a passage that conveys the products of combustion from an appliance to the outside air (see Diagram 2).
223_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Flueblock chimney systems consist of a set of factory-made components, made from precast concrete, clay or other masonry units, that are designed for assembly on site to provide a complete chimney having the performance appropriate for the intended appliance."

230_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A flue box is a factory made unit, usually made of metal, which is similar to a prefabricated appliance chamber except that it is designed to accommodate a gas burning appliance in conjunction with a factory-made chimney."
231_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A flueless appliance is one which is designed to be used without connection to a flue.
232_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Its products of combustion mix with the surrounding room air and are eventually transported to the outside as stale air leaves the room (see Diagram 4(g)).
233_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A flue liner is the wall of the chimney that is in contact with the products of combustion (see Diagram 2), such as a concrete flue liner, the inner liner of a factory-made chimney system or a flexible liner fitted into an existing chimney."
234_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A flue outlet is the point at which the products of combustion are discharged from the flue to the outside atmosphere, such as the top of a chimney pot or flue terminal."
235_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A fluepipe is a pipe, either single walled (bare or insulated) or double walled, which connects a combustion appliance to a flue in a chimney."
236_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For clarity, when used in this way, it may be called a connecting fluepipe."
237_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,(Fluepipe is also used to describe the tubular components from which some factory made chimneys for gas and oil appliances are made or from which plastic flue systems are made).
238_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A hearth is a base intended to safely isolate a combustion appliance from people, combustible parts of the building fabric and soft furnishings."
239_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The exposed surface of the hearth provides a region around the appliance which can be kept clear of anything at risk of fire.
240_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The body of the hearth may be thin insulating board, a substantial thickness of material such as concrete or some intermediate provision dependent upon the weight and downward heat emission characteristics of the appliance(s) upon it (see Diagram 6)."
241_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The heat input rate is the maximum rate of energy flow into an appliance.
242_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It is calculated as the rate of fuel flow to the appliance multiplied by either the fuel’s gross or net calorific value.
243_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Note: Traditionally, the UK has used Gross values, most European standards use Net values."
244_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Thus for gas appliances it is now the norm to express this rating as a net value (kW (net)).

299_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Note: Whilst, for the purposes of requirement J3, it is considered appropriate to require carbon monoxide alarms only when fixed appliances that burn solid fuel, gas (excluding gas appliances used solely for cooking) and oil are installed, such alarms can still reduce the risk of poisoning from other types of appliance."
301_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Combustion appliances require ventilation to supply them with air for combustion.
302_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Ventilation is also required to ensure the proper operation of flues or, in the case of flueless appliances, to ensure that the products of combustion are safely dispersed to the outside air."
303_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Installation of room-sealed appliances or those with a directly connected ducted external air supply will minimise ventilation energy losses from the room and the risk of cold draughts.
304_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In some cases, combustion appliances may also require air for cooling control systems and/or to ensure that casings remain safe to touch (see Diagram 8). General guidance on where it may be necessary to install air vents for these purposes is given below."
305_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Air vent sizes, which are dependent upon 1.3 the type of fuel burned, are given in Sections 2, 3 and 4 and are for one combustion appliance only."
306_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The air supply provisions will usually need to be increased where a room contains more than one appliance (such as a kitchen containing an open-flued boiler and an open-flued cooker).

310_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,flued appliance must receive a certain amount of air from outside (‘combustion air’ in Diagram 8) dependent upon its type and rating.
311_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Infiltration through the building fabric may be sufficient but for certain appliance ratings and forms of construction, permanent openings are necessary (see Diagram 8)."
313_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Appliance compartments that enclose open-flued combustion appliances should be provided with vents large enough to admit all of the air required by the appliance for combustion and proper flue operation, whether the compartment draws its air from a room or directly from outside (see Diagram 8 (b) and (c))."
314_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where appliances require cooling air, appliance compartments should be large enough to enable air to circulate and high- and low-level vents should be provided (see Diagram 8 (d), (e), (f) and (g))."
315_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where appliances are to be installed within balanced compartments (see paragraph 0.4(2)), special provisions will be necessary and the appliance and ventilation system manufacturer’s instructions should be followed."
317_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"If an appliance is room-sealed but takes its 1.8 combustion air from another space in the building (such as the roof void) or if a flue has a permanent opening to another space in the building (such as where it feeds a secondary flue in the roof void), that space should have ventilation openings directly to outside."
318_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where the roof-space is to be used as a source of air for a combustion installation serving a dwelling, the dwelling roof ventilation provisions suggested in Approved Document C would normally be satisfactory."
319_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where flued appliances are supplied with combustion air through air vents which open into adjoining rooms or spaces, the adjoining rooms or spaces should have air vent openings of at least the same size direct to the outside."

341_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Ventilation openings should not be made in fire-resisting walls other than external walls (although they should not penetrate those parts of external walls shielding LPG tanks).
342_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Air vents should not be located within a fireplace recess except on the basis of specialist advice.
343_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A way of meeting the requirement would be to size permanently open air vents so that their equivalent area is sufficient for the appliance(s) to be installed (taking account where necessary of obstructions such as grilles and anti-vermin mesh), and to site them:"
344_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,outside fireplace recesses and beyond the hearths of open fires so that dust or ash will not be disturbed by draughts; and
345_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,in a location unlikely to cause discomfort from cold draughts.
346_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where ventilation is to be provided via a single proprietary assembly, for example when it is proposed to use a proprietary ventilator with integral grilles to bridge a cavity wall, the equivalent area of the ventilator should be taken as that declared by the manufacturer having been measured by the method in BS EN 13141-1:2004."
347_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where two or more components are to be used to provide a non-proprietary assembly, the assembly should be kept as simple and smooth as possible."
348_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The assembly should be taken to have an equivalent area equal to that of the component with the smallest equivalent area in the assembly.
349_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The equivalent area stated in the ventilator manufacturer’s literature or marked on the air vent should be used whenever it is available, as this can differ considerably from the free area measured at one end of the air vent."
350_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"When this is not available the equivalent area of a simple ventilator with no internal baffles can be taken as the total unobstructed cross-sectional area, measured in the plane where this area is at a minimum and at right angles to the direction of air flow."
351_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For an airbrick, grille or louvre with apertures no smaller than 5mm, it will be the aggregate free area of the individual apertures as shown Diagram 9."
354_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Grilles or meshes protecting air vents from the entry of animals or birds should have aperture dimensions no smaller than 5mm.
355_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Discomfort from cold draughts can be avoided by supplying air directly to appliances, locating vents close to appliances (for example by using floor vents), by drawing air from intermediate spaces such as hallways or by ensuring good mixing of incoming cold air by placing external air vents close to ceilings (see Diagrams 10 and 11)."
356_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,In noisy areas it may be necessary to install noise-attenuated ventilators to limit the entry of noise into the building.
357_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Transfer or connecting ventilation should be at low level to reduce the transfer of smoke in the event of a fire and otherwise meet the guidance given in Approved Document B.
358_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Buildings may have air-tight membranes in their floors to isolate them from the ground below.

363_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Rooms or spaces intended to contain open-flued combustion appliances may need permanent ventilation to comply with Part J and adjustable ventilation to comply with Part F. Permanently open air vents for combustion appliances can be accepted in place of some or all of the adjustable background ventilation for health, dependent upon opening area and location."
364_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,However adjustable vents installed to meet the requirements of Part F cannot be used as substitutes for the ventilation openings needed to comply with Part J unless they are fixed permanently open.
365_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Rooms or spaces intended to contain flueless appliances may need: permanent ventilation and purge ventilation (such as openable windows) to comply with Part J; and adjustable ventilation and rapid ventilation to comply with Part F. Permanent ventilation provisions to comply with Part J may be acceptable in place of adjustable ventilation provisions for Part F subject to the limitations described in Paragraph 1.18.
366_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Openable elements installed for the rapid ventilation of rooms and other provisions made for the rapid ventilation of kitchens, in order to comply with Part F, may be acceptable in place of openable elements for the rapid ventilation of rooms or spaces containing flueless appliances."

375_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Extract fans lower the pressure in a building, which can cause the spillage of combustion products from open-flued appliances."
376_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,This can occur even if the appliance and the fan are in different rooms.
377_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Ceiling fans produce air currents and hence local depressurisation, which can also cause the spillage of flue gases from open-flued appliances or from solid fuel open fires."
378_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In buildings where it is intended to install open-flued combustion appliances and extract fans, the combustion appliances should be able to operate safely whether or not the fans are running."
379_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A way of showing compliance in these circumstances would be to follow the installation guidance below, and to show by tests that combustion appliances operate safely whether or not fans are running."
380_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For gas appliances: where a kitchen contains an open-flued appliance, the extract rate of the kitchen extract fan should not exceed 20 litres/second (72m³/hour)."
381_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,For oil appliances: where a room contains an open-flued appliance the extract rate should be limited to 40 litres/second for an appliance with a pressure jet burner and 20 litres/second for an appliance with a vaporising burner.
382_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,For solid fuel appliances: avoid installing extract ventilation in the same room.
383_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,An open-flued appliance in a kitchen may satisfy the requirements of Part F through passive stack ventilation.
384_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Refer to Approved Document F. If mechanical extraction is unavoidable then seek specialist advice to ensure safe operation of the appliance.
385_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For commercial and industrial installations, specialist advice may be necessary regarding the possible need for the interlocking of gas heaters and any mechanical ventilation systems."
386_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,When fans are used to extract radon from below a building follow the guidance in BRE Good Building Guide GBG 25.
387_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A suitable test would be to check for spillage when appliances are subjected to the greatest possible depressurisation.
388_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A prerequisite for this condition is that all external doors, windows and other adjustable ventilators to outside are closed."
389_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The depressurisation at the appliance will depend on the particular combination of fans in operation (fans in the room containing the appliance and fans elsewhere in the building) and the pattern of open internal doors, hatches etc. which is established at the time of the test (when fans should be on their maximum useable setting), and the specific combination causing the greatest depressurisation at the appliance depends upon the circumstances in each case."
390_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Several tests (which should include a test with the door leading into the room of installation closed and all fans in that room switched on) may therefore be necessary to demonstrate the safe operation of the appliance with reasonable certainty.
391_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The effect of ceiling fans should be checked during the tests.
392_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The presence of some fans may be obvious, such as those on view in kitchens, but others may be less obvious: fans installed in domestic appliances such as tumble dryers and fans fitted to other open-flued combustion appliances can also contribute to depressurisation."

511_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,This is necessary both when an appliance is first installed and subsequently when the appliance is serviced:
515_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• any required gradient of fall back to the boiler (required to recover the condensate produced as part of the combustion process) and any other required drain points have been provided.
516_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Means of access for flues needs to be sufficiently sized and positioned to allow a visual inspection to be undertaken of the flue, particularly at any joints in the flue."
517_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It is not intended that the means of access should be sized to allow full physical access to the flue system.
518_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Diagram 14 shows an acceptable approach for a flue in an ceiling void.
519_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Flues should not pass through another dwelling since access for inspection may not always be available to that dwelling and chimney system running through it.
520_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Flues may pass through communal areas including purpose-designed ducts where inspection access is provided.
521_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Any ‘means of access’ should not impair any fire, thermal or acoustic requirements of the Building Regulations."
522_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Refer to the relevant guidance in Approved Documents B, L and E. Where necessary, inspection panels or hatches should be fitted with resilient seals and provide the similar standards of fire, thermal and acoustic isolation to the surrounding structure."
523_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Access hatches should be at least 300mm x 300mm or larger where necessary to allow sufficient access to the void to look along the length of the flue.
524_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Digram 14 shows an acceptable approach to providing access to a horizontal flue located within a ceiling void.
566_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,measuring at least 300mm square.
567_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"No flue joint within the void should be more than 1.5m distant from the edge of the nearest inspection hatch, i.e. dimension x in the diagram should be less than 1.5m."
568_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Where possible inspection hatches should be located at changes of direction.
569_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Where this is not possible then bends should be viewable from both directions.
571_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Flue systems should offer least resistance to the passage of flue gases by minimising changes in direction or horizontal length.
572_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of meeting the requirement would be to build flues so that they are straight and vertical except for the connections to combustion appliances with rear outlets where the horizontal section should not exceed 150mm.
573_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where bends are essential, they should be angled at no more than 45° to the vertical."
574_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Provisions should be made to enable flues to be swept and inspected.
575_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A way of making reasonable provision would be to limit the number of changes of direction between the combustion appliance outlet and the flue outlet to not more than four (each up to 45°), with not more than two of these being between an intended point of access for sweeping and either another point of access for sweeping or the flue outlet."
576_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"(90° factory-made bends, elbows or Tee pieces in fluepipes may be treated as being equal to two 45° bends (see Diagram 15))."
582_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A flue should not have openings into more than one room or space except for the purposes of:
583_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,inspection or cleaning; or
584_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"fitting an explosion door, draught break, draught stabiliser or draught diverter."
585_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Openings for inspection and cleaning should be formed using purpose factory-made components compatible with the flue system, having an access cover that has the same level of gas-tightness as the flue system and an equal level of thermal insulation."
586_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Openings for cleaning the flue should allow easy passage of the sweeping brush.
588_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,combustible except where fitted to a combustible fluepipe (such as a plastic fluepipe).
589_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"After the appliance has been installed, it should be possible to sweep the whole flue."
591_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Flues discharging at low level near boundaries should do so at positions where the building owner will always be able to ensure safe flue gas dispersal.
592_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A way of achieving this where owners of adjacent land could build up to the boundary would be to adopt the suggestions in Diagram 34 or 41, as relevant."
594_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where a decorative treatment, such as a fireplace surround, masonry cladding or dry lining, is provided around a fireplace opening, any gaps that could allow flue gases to escape from the fireplace opening into the void behind the decorative treatment should be sealed to prevent such leakage."
595_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The sealing material should be capable of remaining in place despite any relative movement between the decorative treatment and the fireplace recess.
597_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Responsibility for achieving compliance with the requirements of Part J rests with the person carrying out the work.
598_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"That ‘person’ may be, e.g., a specialist firm directly engaged by a private client or it may be a developer or main contractor who has carried out work subject to Part J or engaged a sub-contractor to carry it out."
599_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In order to document the steps taken to achieve compliance with the requirements, a report should be drawn up showing that materials and components appropriate to the intended application have been used and that flues have passed appropriate tests."
600_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A suggested checklist for such a report is given at Appendix A and guidance on testing is given at Appendix E. Other forms of report may be acceptable.
601_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Specialist firms should provide the report to the client, developer or main contractor, who may be asked for documentation by the Building Control Body."
604_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Flues should be checked at completion to show that they are free from obstructions, satisfactorily gas-tight and constructed with materials and components of sizes which suit the intended application."
605_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where the building work includes the installation of a combustion appliance, tests should cover fluepipes and [the gas-tightness of] joints between fluepipes and combustion appliance outlets."
606_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A spillage test to check for compliance with J2 should be carried out with the appliance under fire, as part of the process of commissioning to check for compliance with Part L, and (in relevant cases) as required by the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations."
607_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Hearths should be constructed with materials and components of sizes to suit the intended application and should show the area where combustible materials should not intrude.
609_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where a hearth, fireplace (including a flue box), flue or chimney is provided or extended (including cases where a flue is provided as part of the refurbishment work), information essential to the correct application and use of these facilities should be permanently posted in the building."
610_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of meeting this requirement would be to provide a notice plate as shown in Diagram 16 conveying the following information:
611_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"the location of the hearth, fireplace (or flue box) or the location of the beginning of the flue;"
612_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,the category of the flue and generic types of appliances that can be safely accommodated;
613_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,the type and size of the flue (or its liner if it has been relined) and the manufacturer’s name;
614_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,the installation date.
615_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Notice plates should be robust, indelibly marked and securely fixed in an unobtrusive but obvious position within the building such as:"

617_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,next to the chimney or hearth described; or
618_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,next to the water supply stop-cock.
619_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For chimney products whose performance characteristics have been assessed in accordance with a European Standard (EN) and which are supplied or marked with a designation, the installer may optionally include this designation on the label as shown in Diagram 16."
621_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,There should be a permanent means of safe access to appliances for maintenance.
622_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Roof space installations of gas-fired appliances should comply with the requirements of BS 6798:2009.
627_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Fluepipes should have the same diameter or equivalent cross-sectional area as that of the appliance flue outlet and should not be smaller than the size recommended by the appliance manufacturer.
628_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Flues should be at least the size shown in Table 2 relevant to the particular appliance, and not less than the size of the appliance flue outlet or that recommended by the appliance manufacturer."
630_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"be to adopt the general guidance given in Section 1, beginning at Paragraph 1.2, in conjunction with the guidance below."
631_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Any room or space containing an 2.2 appliance should have a permanent air vent opening of at least the size shown in Table 1.
632_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,For appliances designed to burn a range of different solid fuels the air supply should be designed to accommodate burning the fuel that produces the highest heating output.
633_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Some manufacturers may specify even larger areas of permanently open air vents or omit to specify a rated output (for example in the case of a cooker).
634_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In these cases, manufacturers’ installation instructions should be followed subject to any minimum ventilation provisions of this Approved Document."
638_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Open appliance, such as an open fire with no throat, e.g. a fire under a canopy as in Diagram 23."

657_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,1:2004 or estimated according to paragraph 1.14.
659_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For simple open fires as depicted in Diagram 29, the requirement can be met with room ventilation areas as follows:"
669_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Example: an appliance with a flue draught stabiliser and a rated output of 7kW would require an equivalent area of: [5 x 300] + [2 x 850] = 3200mm2 4.
670_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It is unlikely that a dwelling constructed prior to 2008 will have an air permeability of less than 5.0m3/(h.m2) at 50 Pa unless extensive measures have been taken to improve air-tightness.
671_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,See Appendix F.
674_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For multi-fuel appliances, the flue should 2.6 be sized to accommodate burning the fuel that requires the largest flue."
689_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,125mm diameter This may be reduced to no less than 100mm when permitted by the appliance manufacturer and supported by calculation according to BS EN 13384-1:2002.
690_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,This calculation can be applied to an individual installation or manufacturers can provide precalculated designs.
698_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Closed appliances include cookers, stoves, room heaters and boilers."
699_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Fuels such as bituminous coal, untreated wood or compressed paper are not smokeless or low-volatiles fuels."
700_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,These appliances are known as ‘exempted fireplaces’.
701_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,For fireplaces with openings larger than 2.7 500mm x 550mm or fireplaces exposed on two or more sides (such as a fireplace under a canopy or open on both sides of a central chimney breast) a way of showing compliance would be to provide a flue with a cross-sectional area equal to 15 per cent of the total face area of the fireplace opening(s) (see Appendix B).
702_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, specialist advice should be sought when proposing to construct flues having an area of:"
703_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,more than 15 per cent of the total face area of the fireplace openings; or
704_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"more than 120,000mm² (0.12m²)."
706_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,sufficient draught to clear the products of combustion.
707_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The height necessary for this will depend upon the type of the appliance, the height of the building, the type of flue and the number of bends in it, and an assessment of local wind patterns."
708_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, a minimum flue height of 4.5m could be satisfactory if the guidance in Paragraphs 2.10 to 2.12 is adopted."
709_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"As an alternative approach, the calculation procedure within BS EN 13384-1:2005 can be used as the basis for deciding whether a chimney design will provide sufficient draught."
710_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The height of a flue serving an open fire is 2.9 measured vertically from the highest point at which air can enter the fireplace to the level at which the flue discharges into the outside air.
711_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The highest point of air entry into the fireplace could be the top of the fireplace opening or, for a fire under a canopy, the bottom of the canopy."
712_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The height of a flue serving a closed appliance is measured vertically from the appliance outlet.
714_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The outlet from a flue should be above the roof of the building in a position where the products of combustion can discharge freely and will not present a fire hazard, whatever the wind conditions."
715_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Flue outlet positions which can meet the requirements in common circumstances are shown in Diagram 17.
717_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"or separations shown may need to be increased in particular cases where wind exposure, surrounding tall buildings, high trees or high ground could have adverse effects on flue draught."

734_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,At least 1000mm above the top of the opening.
735_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,At least 600mm above any part of the adjacent building within 2300mm.
737_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The weather surface is the building external surface, such as its roof, tiles or external walls."
738_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A flat roof has a pitch less than 10°.
739_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The clearances given for A or B, as appropriate, will also apply."
740_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A vertical flue fixed to an outside wall should be treated as equivalent to an inside flue emerging at the nearest edge of the roof.
744_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A way of meeting the requirements where flues discharge on or in close proximity to roofs with surfaces which are readily ignitable, such as where roofs are covered in thatch or shingles, would be to increase the clearances to flue outlets to those shown in Diagram 18."
745_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Note: Thatched roofs can sometimes be vulnerable to spontaneous combustion caused by heat transferred from flues building up in thick layers of thatch in contact with the chimney.
746_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,To reduce the risk it is recommended that rigid twin-walled insulated metal flue liners be used within a ventilated (top and bottom) masonry chimney void provided they are adequately supported and not in direct contact with the masonry.
748_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,-metallic chimneys and cast in-situ flue liners can also be used provided the heat transfer to the thatch is assessed in relation to the depth of thatch and risk of spontaneous combustion.
749_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Spark arrestors are not generally recommended as they can be difficult to maintain and may increase the risk of flue blockage and flue fires.
750_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Further information and recommendations are contained in Hetas Information Paper 1/007 Chimneys in Thatched Properties.
752_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,For connecting fluepipes a way of meeting the requirements would be to follow the general guidance in Paragraphs 1.32 and 1.33.
754_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Connecting fluepipes should be used only to connect appliances to their chimneys.
774_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,a chimney through either a wall of the chimney or a floor supporting the chimney.
775_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Connecting fluepipes should also be guarded if they could be at risk of damage or if the burn hazard they present to people is not immediately apparent.
776_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Connecting fluepipes should be located so as to avoid igniting combustible material.
777_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Ways of meeting the requirement include minimising horizontal and sloping runs and:
781_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,separation by shielding in accordance with Diagram 19.
783_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where a chimney cannot be cleaned through the appliance, a debris collecting space which is accessible for emptying and suitably sized opening(s) for cleaning should be provided at appropriate locations in the chimney."
785_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Masonry chimneys should be built in accordance with Paragraphs 1.27 and 1.28.
786_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Flueblock chimneys should be built in accordance with Paragraphs 1.29 and 1.30.
787_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The minimum chimney thickness and distance to combustibles (xxmm) should be no less than the manufacturer’s product declaration (Gxx) based on testing to BS EN 1858:2008 (concrete flue blocks) or BS EN 1806:2006 (clay/ceramic flueblocks).
788_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Other masonry chimney products should exceed the minimum thickness indicated in Diagram 20.
793_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Combustible material should not be located where it could be ignited by the heat dissipating through the walls of fireplaces or masonry flues.
794_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of meeting the requirement would be to follow the guidance in Diagram 21 so that combustible material is at least:
795_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,200mm from the inside surface of a flue or fireplace recess; or
796_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,at least xxmm from a flue product with designated separation distance (Gxx); or
797_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"40mm from the outer surface of a masonry chimney or fireplace recess unless it is a floorboard, skirting board, dado or picture rail, mantel-shelf or architrave."
798_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Metal fixings in contact with combustible materials should be at least 50mm from the inside surface of a flue.
800_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of meeting the requirements would be to comply with Paragraphs 1.42 to 1.46 in Section 1 (but not Paragraph 1.42(b)).
801_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The appropriate designation is given in Table 3.
803_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Lining or relining flues may be building work and, in any case, such work should be carried out so that the objectives of J2 to J5 are met (see Paragraphs 1.34 and 1.35)."
804_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Existing flues being re-used should be checked as described in Paragraph 1.36.
805_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Ways of meeting the requirements include the use of:

810_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,liners as described in Paragraph 1.27.
826_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"To minimise resistance to the proper working of flues, tapered gathers should be provided in fireplaces for open fires."
827_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Ways of achieving these gathers include:
828_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"using prefabricated gather components built into a fireplace recess, as shown in Diagram 22(a); or"

831_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,using a prefabricated appliance chamber incorporating a gather.
839_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Hearths should be constructed of suitably robust materials and to appropriate dimensions such that, in normal use, they prevent combustion appliances setting fire to the building fabric and furnishings, and they limit the risk of people being accidentally burnt."
840_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of making provision would be to adopt the guidance in Paragraphs 2.23 to 2.28 and to provide a hearth appropriate to the temperatures the appliance can create around it.
841_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The hearth should be able to accommodate the weight of the appliance and its chimney if the chimney is not independently supported.
842_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Appliances should stand wholly above:
844_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"sheet material or tiles at least 12mm thick, if the appliance is not to stand in an appliance recess and has been tested to an applicable appliance standard to verify that it cannot cause the temperature of the upper surface of the hearth to exceed 100°C; or"
845_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,constructional hearths in accordance with the paragraphs below.
846_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Constructional hearths should:
847_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,have plan dimensions as shown in Diagram 24; and
849_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,combustible floor and/or decorative surface.
850_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Combustible material should not be placed beneath constructional hearths unless there is an air-space of at least 50mm between the underside of the hearth and the combustible material, or the combustible material is at least 250mm below the top of the hearth (see Diagram 25)."
857_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Fireplaces for open fires need to be constructed such that they adequately protect the building fabric from catching fire.
858_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of achieving the requirements would be to build:
859_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,fireplace recesses from masonry or concrete as shown in Diagram 28; or
860_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,prefabricated factory-made appliance chambers using components that are made of insulating concrete having a density of between 1200 and 1700 kg/m³ and with the minimum thickness as shown in Table 4.

861_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,An appliance should be located on a hearth so that it is surrounded by a surface free of combustible material as shown in Diagram 26.
862_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"This surface may be part of the surface of the hearth provided in accordance with Paragraph 2.23, or it may be the surface of a superimposed hearth laid wholly or partly upon a constructional hearth."
863_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The boundary of this surface should be visually apparent to provide a warning to the building occupants and to discourage combustible floor finishes such as carpet from being laid too close to the appliance.
864_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of achieving this would be to provide a change in level.
865_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Dimensions shown in Diagram 26 may be reduced to manufacturer’s recommendations for appliances with surface temperatures not exceeding 85°C when in normal operation and where there is no risk of spillage of fuel or ash.
866_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Combustible material placed on or beside a constructional hearth should not extend under a superimposed hearth by more than 25mm or to closer than 150mm measured horizontally to the appliance.

893_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A fireplace recess may require protection from heat if it is to provide a durable setting for certain appliances such as inset open fires.
894_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Suitable protection would be fireplace lining components as shown in Diagram 29 or lining the recess with suitable firebricks.
896_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Walls that are not part of a fireplace recess or a prefabricated appliance chamber but are adjacent to hearths or appliances also need to protect the building from catching fire.
897_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of achieving the requirement is shown in Diagram 30.
898_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Thinner material could be used provided it gives the same overall level of protection as the solid non-combustible material.
899_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Clearances shown in Diagram 30 may be reduced to manufacturer’s recommendations for appliances with surface temperatures not exceeding 85°C when in normal operation.

1638_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For LPG storage systems of up to 1.1 tonne capacity, comprising one tank standing in the open air, a way of meeting the requirement J6 would be to comply with the relevant recommendations in the UKLPG Code Of Practice 1: Bulk LPG Storage at Fixed Installations Part 1 (2009) and BS 5482-1:2005 (see Appendix F and ‘Other Publications referred to’) whilst also adopting the following guidance:"
1639_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The LPG tank should be installed outdoors and not within an open pit.
1640_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The tank should be adequately separated from buildings, the boundary and any fixed sources of ignition to enable safe dispersal in the event of venting or leaks and in the event of fire to reduce the risk of fire spreading."
1641_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A way of meeting the requirements in normal situations would be to adopt the separation distances in Table 11 and Diagram 43, which also offers advice on reducing the risk of LPG storage fires igniting the building."
1642_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Drains, gullies and cellar hatches within the separation distances should be protected from gas entry."

1864_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It applies only to natural draught flues intended for open-flued appliances.
1865_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The procedures described are used only to assess whether the flue in the chimney, the connecting fluepipe (and flue gas passages in the appliance) are free of obstruction and acceptably gas-tight."
1866_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In addition, appliance performance tests, including flue spillage tests to check for compliance with J2, should be carried out when an appliance is commissioned to check for compliance with Part L and as required by the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations."

1871_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Check the gas-tightness of the flue by carrying out a smoke test.
1872_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Tests on flues should be carried out at the most appropriate time during the building work.
1873_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where possible, for example, smoke tests should be performed when the structure of a chimney is visible and before the application of finishes such as plaster or dry lining that could obscure sight of smoke leakage during testing."
1876_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Flues in existing chimneys can be obstructed by nests, debris resulting from deterioration of the structure (e.g. brickwork, flue lining material or pieces of chimney pot) and by soot and tar."
1877_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Flues in existing chimneys may also leak as a result of holes or cracks appearing in the structure and linings, particularly at joints."
1878_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The top, exposed part of a chimney is particularly prone to decay."
1879_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of checking the state of a flue prior to bringing it back into use would be to do the following:
1880_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Sweep the flue.
1881_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,This is intended to clean the flue to demonstrate that it is essentially free from obstructions and to enable better visual inspection and testing of the flue.
1882_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Tar deposits caused by burning wood may be especially hard to dislodge and should be removed.
1883_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The debris that comes down the chimney when sweeping should be examined for excessive quantities of lining or brick that are signs that further repairs are necessary.

1893_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of checking the condition of a new flue prior to bringing it into use would be to do the following:
1894_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Carry out a visual inspection of the accessible parts to check that the lining, liners or flueblocks are of the correct materials and of suitable size for the proposed application."
1895_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Perform checks where necessary to demonstrate that the flue is free from restriction: a visual check may be sufficient where the full length of the flue can be seen.
1896_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In cases of doubt, a way of checking this would be to carry out a coring ball test or to sweep the flue, which may be more effective at removing flexible debris that might not be dislodged by a coring ball."
1897_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Check the operation and gas-tightness of the flue by carrying out a smoke test.
1899_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A checklist for the visual inspection of a newly completed factory-made metal chimney is given in BS EN 15287-1:2007 and additional checks or particular variants may be included in manufacturers’ installation instructions.

1904_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"checked to show that it is free from restrictions, such as from surplus material (where that can occur) and that it is acceptably gas-tight by using the same tests as would be applied in the case of a newly built flue."
1905_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, a flue which has been relined with a flexible metal liner in accordance with Paragraph 3.36 of this Approved Document may be assumed to be unobstructed and acceptably gas-tight."
1908_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where a combustion appliance is provided and connected up to the flue system as part of the work, the complete system of appliance and flue should be tested for gas-tightness in addition to testing the flue separately as above."
1909_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For gas appliances, an appropriate spillage test procedure is given in BS 5440-1:2008."
1910_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For oil- and solid-fuel fired appliances, suitable test procedures are given in BS 5410-1:1997 and BS EN 15287-1:2007 Annex O respectively."
1913_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,This test may be appropriate for proving E9 the minimum diameter of circular flues.
1914_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It may also be used to check for obstructions in square flues but will not detect obstructions in the corners.
1916_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It is not applicable to fluepipes and should not be used with flexible metal flue liners.

1925_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Test II may be used where the flue is to serve a gas-fired appliance.
1926_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Neither test is a substitute for any spillage or flue draught interference test required when commissioning the appliance.
1930_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,All doors and windows in the room served by the flue should be closed.
1931_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The flue should first be warmed to establish a draught, e.g. with a blow lamp or electric heater."
1932_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A suitable number of flue testing smoke pellets are placed at the base of the flue, such as in the fireplace recess or in the appliance if it is fitted, and ignited."
1933_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"When smoke starts to form, the base of the flue or fireplace opening should be sealed or the appliance should be closed, so that the smoke can only enter the flue."
1935_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Smoke should be seen to issue freely from the flue outlet or terminal.
1936_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"When this is established, the top of the flue is sealed."
1937_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The full length of the flue should then be checked, bearing in mind Paragraph E19; there should be no significant leakage."
1938_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The test should be allowed to continue for at least 5 minutes.
1939_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The closures at the top and bottom of the flue should then be removed.
1941_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,All doors and windows in the room served by the flue should be closed.
1942_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The flue should first be warmed to establish a draught.
1943_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A suitable flue-testing smoke pellet is ignited at the base of the flue or in the intended position of the appliance, so that the smoke is drawn into the flue with the rising draught."
1945_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Smoke should be seen to issue freely from the flue outlet or terminal and not to spill back into the room.
1946_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,There should be no significant leakage of smoke from the length of the chimney inside or outside of the building.
1947_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Smoke tests I and II are in line with the recommendations in BS 5440-1:2008.
1949_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where warming of the flue is specified, this is intended to establish a draught, but this may take more than 10 minutes in the case of large or cold flues."
1950_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Appliances, where fitted, should not be under fire at the time of carrying out the test."
1951_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"During a smoke test, smoke should not emerge from the outlet of any other flue, as this indicates leakage between flues."
1952_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"When checking for smoke leakage from a flue, it should be borne in mind that smoke from a faulty flue can emerge some distance away from the original fault."
1953_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In such cases, the smoke could emerge from such places as barge overhangs in the end of terrace dwellings or from window reveals in cavity walls."
1954_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems Approved Document JONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION APPENDIX E E20 The purpose of carrying out smoke testing is to check that flue gases will rise freely through the flue and to identify whether there are any faults, such as incorrectly sealed joints or damage that would cause the flue gases to escape into the dwelling."
1955_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It should be noted that smoke pellets E21 create a pressure significantly higher than the pressure required in the product standards for natural draught chimneys and for flues having a gas-tightness designation of N1.
1956_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Flues to this designation are permitted to have a leakage rate of up to 2 litre/s/m² flue wall area.
1957_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Some smoke leakage may therefore be seen during smoke tests and it can be a matter of expert judgement of whether leakage indicates failure.
1958_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, wisps of smoke visible on the outside of the chimney or near joints between chimney sections do not necessarily indicate a fault."
1959_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"If forceful plumes, or large volumes of smoke are seen, this could indicate a major fault such as an incorrectly made connection or joint, or a damaged section of chimney that requires investigation and remedial action followed by a repeat of the test."
1963_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Failure to implement even a few of these F3 measures will typically mean that the overall air permeability will probably exceed 5.0 m3/(h.m2) at 50 Pa.
1964_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, individual rooms in some older houses with solid walls and solid floors can be inherently air-tight when fitted with modern glazing."

1970_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The minimum requirements for permanent F1 ventilation for certain appliances depend on a knowledge of the air-tightness of the dwelling where they are to be installed, Dwellings built after 2008 are likely to have evidence of the air-tightness either through an individual air permeability test certificate or through representative testing of the same design of dwelling on the same housing development."
1971_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Older houses are unlikely to have been F2 tested but are unlikely to achieve an air permeability of less than 5.0 m3/(h.m2) at 50 Pa unless the building fabric has been substantially upgraded.
1972_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,That would include all or most of the following measures:

1990_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,J Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems Approved Document JONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Appendix G: European chimney designations This informative appendix provides a G1 summary of the European chimney designation scheme.
1991_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The essence of the scheme is a series of code letters based on the general chimney designation scheme of BS EN 1443:2003, an example of which and their explanation is given below."
1993_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The designation of a chimney consists of :
1998_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"European chimney standards have been G3 developed based on the material of the flue liner e.g. clay/ceramic, concrete, metal, and plastic."
1999_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Some material based standards have adopted a different shortened designation e.g. for clay flue liners a designation Liner – EN 1457-300-A1-N2 means it is suitable for a chimney with the designation T600 N2 D 3 G, with a nominal size of 300mm."
2000_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The designation of the corrosion G4 resistance class of a metal chimney product is dealt with in BS EN 1856-1 and BS EN 1856-2 by a two-fold approach.
2001_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A minimum material specification and thickness is allowed which is dependent on that which is permitted in member states regulations, where these exist."
2002_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Products upon which a declaration has been made in this manner are designated Vm.
2003_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The alternative approach involves the choice of one of three corrosion resistance tests.
2004_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Products meeting the tests carry the designation V1, V2 or V3, as appropriate allow the product to be designated with the Corrosion resistance class 1, 2, or 3 respectively."
2005_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The material specification still forms part of the overall designation, and appears alongside the ‘V’ letter, e.g. Vx-L40045."
2006_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The material specification for the liner (or connecting pipe) is formed by the letter ‘L’ followed by five digits.
2007_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The first two digits represent the material type and the last three digits represent the material thickness in multiples of 0.01mm.
2008_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For the UK, guidance on the minimum G5 material specification appropriate for the various applications in terms of corrosion resistance (solid fuel, gas and oil) is given in the UK National Annex to BS EN 1856-1 and -2."
