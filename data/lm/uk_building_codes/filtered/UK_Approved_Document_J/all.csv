8_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Types of work covered by this Approved Document
9_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Building work
10_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Building work, as defined in regulation 3 of the Building Regulations 2010, includes the erection and extension of a building, the provision or extension of a controlled service or fitting, and the material alteration of a building or a controlled service or fitting."
11_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In addition, Building Regulations may apply in cases where the purposes for which or the manner or circumstances in which a building or part of a building is used change in the way that constitutes a material change of use."
12_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Under regulation 4 of the Building Regulations 2010 (as amended), building work should be carried out in such a way that, on completion of work,"
13_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"the building complies with the applicable Parts of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations,"
14_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"in the case of an extension or material alteration of a building, or the provision, extension or material alteration of a controlled service or fitting, where it did not comply with any such requirement, it is no more unsatisfactory in relation to that requirement than before the work was carried out."
15_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Work described in Part J concerns the provision or extension of controlled services or fittings.
16_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Work associated with installations covered in these sections may be subject to other relevant Parts of the Building Regulations.
17_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Material change of use A material change of use occurs in specified circumstances in which a building or part of a building that was previously used for one purpose will be used in future for another.
18_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Where there is a material change of use the Building Regulations set requirements that must be met before the building can be used for its new purpose.
19_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Regulation 5 of the Building Regulations specifies the following circumstances as material changes of use:
20_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building is used as a dwelling where previously it was not.
21_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building contains a flat where previously it did not.
22_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building is used as an hotel or boarding house where previously it was not.
23_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building is used as an institution where previously it was not.
24_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building is used as a public building where previously it was not.
25_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building no longer comes within the exemptions in Schedule 2 to the Building Regulations where previously it did.
26_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building which contains at least one dwelling contains a greater or lesser number of dwellings than it did previously.
27_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building contains a room for residential purposes where previously it did not.
28_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building which contains at least one room for residential puposes contains a greater or lesser number of such rooms than it did previously.
29_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• a building is used as a shop where previously it was not.
30_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Parts J1 to J4 will apply to all the material changes of use mentioned above which means that whenever such changes occur the building must be brought up to the standards required by Parts J1 to J4.
31_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Historic buildings
32_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Buildings included in the schedule of monuments maintained under section 1 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 are exempt from compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.

34_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,JApproved Document J Combustion appliances and fuel storage systemsONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION J THE REQUIREMENTS
35_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,There are other classes of buildings where special consideration may be needed in deciding what is adequate provision for compliance with Part J:
36_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,listed buildings;
37_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,buildings situated in designated conservation areas;
38_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,buildings which are of architectural or historic interest and which are referred to as a material consideration in a local authority’s development plan; and
39_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"buildings of architectural and historical interest within national parks, areas of outstanding or natural beauty and world heritage sites."
40_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It would not normally be considered appropriate to relax the requirements of Part J since they relate to health and safety.
41_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, it may be necessary to seek alternative technical solutions to those set out in this approved document in order to achieve reasonable standards of safety without prejudicing the character of the host building or increasing the risk of long-term deterioration of the building’s fabric or fittings."
42_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In determining what is appropriate in the circumstances, the advice of the local authority’s conservation officer should be sought."
43_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The views of the conservation officer are particularly important where building work requires planning permission and/or listed building consent.
44_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Notification of work
45_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,In almost all cases of new building work it will be necessary to notify a Building Control Body (BCB) in advance of any work starting.
46_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"There are two exceptions to this: where work is carried out under a self-certification scheme listed in Schedule 3, and where work is listed in Schedule 4 to the Building Regulations as being not notifiable."
47_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Competent person self-certification schemes under Schedule 3
48_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Under regulation 12(6) of the Building Regulations it is not necessary to notify a BCB in advance of work which is covered by this Approved Document if that work is of a type set out in column 1 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations and is carried out by a person registered with a relevant self-certification (competent persons) scheme as set out in column 2 of that Schedule.
49_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In order to join such a scheme a person must demonstrate competence to carry out the type of work the scheme covers, and also the ability to comply with all relevant requirements in the Building Regulations."
50_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,There are a number of schemes authorised for the installation of combustion appliances.
51_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Details of current schemes including those 6

54_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Full details of the schemes can be found on the individual scheme websites.
55_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where work is carried out by a person registered with a competent person scheme, regulation 20 of the Building Regulations and regulation 20(1) of the Building (Approved Inspectors etc.)"
56_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Regulations 2010 require that the occupier of the building be given, within 30 days of the completion of the work, a certificate confirming that the work complies with all applicable Building Regulation requirements."
57_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"There is a also requirement that the BCB be given a notice that this has been done, or a copy of the certificate, again within 30 days of the completion of the work."
58_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,These certificates and notices are usually made available through the scheme operator.
59_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,BCBs are authorised to accept these certificates as evidence of compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.
60_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, local authority inspection and enforcement powers remain unaffected, although they are normally used only in response to a complaint that work does not comply."
61_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Work which is not notifiable under Schedule 4
62_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Schedule 4 to the Building Regulations sets out types of work where there is no requirement to notify a BCB that work is to be carried out.
63_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"These types of work are mainly of a minor nature where there is no significant risk to health, safety, water efficiency or energy efficiency."
64_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Health, safety, and energy efficiency requirements continue to apply to these types of work; only the need to notify a BCB has been removed."
65_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where only non-notifiable work as set out in Schedule 4 is carried out, there is no requirement for a certificate confirming that the work complies with Building Regulation requirements to be given to the occupier or the BCB."
66_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In general, all work on a combustion appliance which is not a repair or maintenance will be notifiable work and Schedule 4 will not apply."
67_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, it might be possible to add a control device to the appliance or to alter its electrical connection under the allowance in this schedule."
68_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Local authority building control departments can give advice in cases of doubt.
69_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Exemptions

160_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A balanced compartment is a method of installing an open-flued appliance into a compartment which is sealed from the remainder of the building and whose ventilation is so arranged in conjunction with the appliance flue as to achieve a balanced flue effect.
161_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A balanced flue appliance is a type of room-
162_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"sealed appliance which draws its combustion air from a point outside the building adjacent to the point at which the combustion products are discharged, the inlet and outlet being so disposed that wind effects are substantially balanced."
163_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Balanced flues may run vertically, but in the most common configuration they discharge horizontally through the external wall against which the appliance is situated."
164_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The boundary is the boundary of the land or buildings belonging to and under the control of the building owner.
165_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Depending upon the paragraphs of this Approved Document to which it applies, it may be drawn only around the perimeter of the land in question or extended to the centreline of adjacent routes or waterways as shown in Diagram 1."

186_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A draught break is an opening formed by a factory-made component into any part of the flue serving an open-flued appliance.
187_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Such openings may be provided to allow dilution air to be drawn into a flue or to lessen the effects of down-draught on combustion in the appliance.
188_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A draught diverter is a form of draught break intended to prevent conditions in the main length of flue from interfering with the combustion performance of an open-flued appliance (see Diagram 3(a)).
189_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It allows the appliance to operate without interference from down-
190_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,draughts that may occur in adverse wind conditions and excessive draught.
191_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Diagram 3 Draught diverter and draught stabiliser
192_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A draught stabiliser is a factory-made counter-balanced flap device admitting air to the flue, from the same space as the combustion air, to prevent excessive variations in the draught (see Diagram 3(b))."
193_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"It is usual for these to be in the fluepipe or chimney, but they may be located on the appliance."
194_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Equivalent area is defined in BS EN

198_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The equivalent area of a simple ventilator will be less than the geometrical free area and for complex products may be significantly less.
199_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Factory-made metal chimneys (also known as system chimneys) are prefabricated chimneys that are commonly manufactured as sets of components for assembly on site (although they can be supplied as one unit), having the performance appropriate for the 12"
200_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,intended appliance.
201_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,They are available in various materials and types ranging from single-walled metal chimneys suitable for some gas appliances to twin-walled chimneys with insulation sandwiched between an inner liner and an outer metal wall which are designed for oil or solid fuel use.
202_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In a fanned draught installation, the proper discharge of the flue gases depends upon the operation of a fan, which may be separately installed in the flue or may be an integral part of the combustion appliance."
203_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Fans in combustion appliances either may extract flue gases from the combustion chamber or may cause the flue gases to be displaced from the combustion chamber if the fan is supplying it with air for combustion.
204_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Appliances with fans providing the combustion air (including most oil-fired and many gas-

300_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Air supply for combustion appliances
301_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Combustion appliances require ventilation to supply them with air for combustion.
302_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Ventilation is also required to ensure the proper operation of flues or, in the case of flueless appliances, to ensure that the products of combustion are safely dispersed to the outside air."
303_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Installation of room-sealed appliances or those with a directly connected ducted external air supply will minimise ventilation energy losses from the room and the risk of cold draughts.
304_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In some cases, combustion appliances may also require air for cooling control systems and/or to ensure that casings remain safe to touch (see Diagram 8). General guidance on where it may be necessary to install air vents for these purposes is given below."
305_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Air vent sizes, which are dependent upon 1.3 the type of fuel burned, are given in Sections 2, 3 and 4 and are for one combustion appliance only."
306_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The air supply provisions will usually need to be increased where a room contains more than one appliance (such as a kitchen containing an open-flued boiler and an open-flued cooker).
307_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A room containing an open-flued appliance Permanently open ventilation of rooms

313_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Appliance compartments that enclose open-flued combustion appliances should be provided with vents large enough to admit all of the air required by the appliance for combustion and proper flue operation, whether the compartment draws its air from a room or directly from outside (see Diagram 8 (b) and (c))."
314_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where appliances require cooling air, appliance compartments should be large enough to enable air to circulate and high- and low-level vents should be provided (see Diagram 8 (d), (e), (f) and (g))."
315_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where appliances are to be installed within balanced compartments (see paragraph 0.4(2)), special provisions will be necessary and the appliance and ventilation system manufacturer’s instructions should be followed."

378_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In buildings where it is intended to install open-flued combustion appliances and extract fans, the combustion appliances should be able to operate safely whether or not the fans are running."
379_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A way of showing compliance in these circumstances would be to follow the installation guidance below, and to show by tests that combustion appliances operate safely whether or not fans are running."
380_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For gas appliances: where a kitchen contains an open-flued appliance, the extract rate of the kitchen extract fan should not exceed 20 litres/second (72m³/hour)."
381_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,For oil appliances: where a room contains an open-flued appliance the extract rate should be limited to 40 litres/second for an appliance with a pressure jet burner and 20 litres/second for an appliance with a vaporising burner.

384_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Refer to Approved Document F. If mechanical extraction is unavoidable then seek specialist advice to ensure safe operation of the appliance.
385_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For commercial and industrial installations, specialist advice may be necessary regarding the possible need for the interlocking of gas heaters and any mechanical ventilation systems."
386_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,When fans are used to extract radon from below a building follow the guidance in BRE Good Building Guide GBG 25.
387_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A suitable test would be to check for spillage when appliances are subjected to the greatest possible depressurisation.
388_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A prerequisite for this condition is that all external doors, windows and other adjustable ventilators to outside are closed."
389_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The depressurisation at the appliance will depend on the particular combination of fans in operation (fans in the room containing the appliance and fans elsewhere in the building) and the pattern of open internal doors, hatches etc. which is established at the time of the test (when fans should be on their maximum useable setting), and the specific combination causing the greatest depressurisation at the appliance depends upon the circumstances in each case."
390_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Several tests (which should include a test with the door leading into the room of installation closed and all fans in that room switched on) may therefore be necessary to demonstrate the safe operation of the appliance with reasonable certainty.
391_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The effect of ceiling fans should be checked during the tests.
392_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The presence of some fans may be obvious, such as those on view in kitchens, but others may be less obvious: fans installed in domestic appliances such as tumble dryers and fans fitted to other open-flued combustion appliances can also contribute to depressurisation."

707_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The height necessary for this will depend upon the type of the appliance, the height of the building, the type of flue and the number of bends in it, and an assessment of local wind patterns."
708_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, a minimum flue height of 4.5m could be satisfactory if the guidance in Paragraphs 2.10 to 2.12 is adopted."
709_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"As an alternative approach, the calculation procedure within BS EN 13384-1:2005 can be used as the basis for deciding whether a chimney design will provide sufficient draught."
710_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The height of a flue serving an open fire is 2.9 measured vertically from the highest point at which air can enter the fireplace to the level at which the flue discharges into the outside air.

856_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Fireplace recesses and prefabricated appliance chambers
857_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Fireplaces for open fires need to be constructed such that they adequately protect the building fabric from catching fire.
858_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of achieving the requirements would be to build:
859_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,fireplace recesses from masonry or concrete as shown in Diagram 28; or
860_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,prefabricated factory-made appliance chambers using components that are made of insulating concrete having a density of between 1200 and 1700 kg/m³ and with the minimum thickness as shown in Table 4. Components should be supplied as sets for assembly and jointing in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
861_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,An appliance should be located on a hearth so that it is surrounded by a surface free of combustible material as shown in Diagram 26.
862_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"This surface may be part of the surface of the hearth provided in accordance with Paragraph 2.23, or it may be the surface of a superimposed hearth laid wholly or partly upon a constructional hearth."
863_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The boundary of this surface should be visually apparent to provide a warning to the building occupants and to discourage combustible floor finishes such as carpet from being laid too close to the appliance.
864_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of achieving this would be to provide a change in level.
865_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Dimensions shown in Diagram 26 may be reduced to manufacturer’s recommendations for appliances with surface temperatures not exceeding 85°C when in normal operation and where there is no risk of spillage of fuel or ash.
866_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Combustible material placed on or beside a constructional hearth should not extend under a superimposed hearth by more than 25mm or to closer than 150mm measured horizontally to the appliance.
867_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Some ways of making these provisions are shown in Diagram 27.

1863_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"This Appendix describes ways of checking E1 the compliance with J2 of existing, relined or new flues, and (where included in the work) the combustion appliance."
1864_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It applies only to natural draught flues intended for open-flued appliances.
1865_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The procedures described are used only to assess whether the flue in the chimney, the connecting fluepipe (and flue gas passages in the appliance) are free of obstruction and acceptably gas-tight."
1866_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In addition, appliance performance tests, including flue spillage tests to check for compliance with J2, should be carried out when an appliance is commissioned to check for compliance with Part L and as required by the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations."

1868_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Correct lining and lining sizes for the proposed new application.
1869_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Perform checks where necessary to demonstrate that the flue is free from restriction: a visual check may be sufficient where the full length of the flue can be seen.
1870_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In cases of doubt, a way of checking this would be to carry out a coring ball test."
1871_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Check the gas-tightness of the flue by carrying out a smoke test.
1872_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Tests on flues should be carried out at the most appropriate time during the building work.
1873_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where possible, for example, smoke tests should be performed when the structure of a chimney is visible and before the application of finishes such as plaster or dry lining that could obscure sight of smoke leakage during testing."
1874_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Testing applications
1875_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Tests for existing flues
1876_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Flues in existing chimneys can be obstructed by nests, debris resulting from deterioration of the structure (e.g. brickwork, flue lining material or pieces of chimney pot) and by soot and tar."
1877_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Flues in existing chimneys may also leak as a result of holes or cracks appearing in the structure and linings, particularly at joints."
1878_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The top, exposed part of a chimney is particularly prone to decay."
1879_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of checking the state of a flue prior to bringing it back into use would be to do the following:
1880_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Sweep the flue.
1881_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,This is intended to clean the flue to demonstrate that it is essentially free from obstructions and to enable better visual inspection and testing of the flue.
1882_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Tar deposits caused by burning wood may be especially hard to dislodge and should be removed.
1883_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The debris that comes down the chimney when sweeping should be examined for excessive quantities of lining or brick that are signs that further repairs are necessary.
1884_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Carry out a visual inspection of the accessible parts to identify:
1885_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Deterioration in the structure, connections or linings which could affect the flue’s gas-tightness and safe performance with the proposed combustion appliance."
1886_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Examine the interior of the flue and the exterior of the chimney including in the roof-space.

1892_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The flues should be checked to demonstrate that they have been correctly constructed and are free of restrictions and acceptably gas-tight.
1893_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,A way of checking the condition of a new flue prior to bringing it into use would be to do the following:
1894_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Carry out a visual inspection of the accessible parts to check that the lining, liners or flueblocks are of the correct materials and of suitable size for the proposed application."
1895_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Perform checks where necessary to demonstrate that the flue is free from restriction: a visual check may be sufficient where the full length of the flue can be seen.
1896_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In cases of doubt, a way of checking this would be to carry out a coring ball test or to sweep the flue, which may be more effective at removing flexible debris that might not be dislodged by a coring ball."
1897_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Check the operation and gas-tightness of the flue by carrying out a smoke test.

1915_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,(A purpose-made coring ball or plate may need to be used if the flue is rectangular.)
1916_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It is not applicable to fluepipes and should not be used with flexible metal flue liners.
1917_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It should be carried out before smoke testing.
1918_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A heavy ball, with a diameter about 25mm less than that of the flue, is lowered on a rope from the flue outlet to the bottom of the flue."
1919_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"If an obstruction is encountered, the blockage should be removed and the test repeated."
1920_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Smoke testing
1921_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where an existing flue is to be checked with a smoke test, it should first be swept."
1922_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Two smoke testing procedures are described below.
1923_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Test I confirms the gas-
1924_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,tightness of the whole flue and may be used for one serving a solid fuel appliance or if there is any doubt over the condition of a gas or oil flue.
1925_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Test II may be used where the flue is to serve a gas-fired appliance.
1926_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Neither test is a substitute for any spillage or flue draught interference test required when commissioning the appliance.
1927_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Other smoke testing procedures could be used where these form part of the procedure for the installation of an approved flue or relining system
1928_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,74
1929_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Smoke test I
1930_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,All doors and windows in the room served by the flue should be closed.
1931_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The flue should first be warmed to establish a draught, e.g. with a blow lamp or electric heater."
1932_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A suitable number of flue testing smoke pellets are placed at the base of the flue, such as in the fireplace recess or in the appliance if it is fitted, and ignited."
1933_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"When smoke starts to form, the base of the flue or fireplace opening should be sealed or the appliance should be closed, so that the smoke can only enter the flue."
1934_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"(For example, the recess opening should be closed off with a board or plate, sealed at the edges or, if the pellets are in the appliance, its doors, ashpit covers and vents should be closed.)"
1935_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Smoke should be seen to issue freely from the flue outlet or terminal.
1936_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"When this is established, the top of the flue is sealed."
1937_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The full length of the flue should then be checked, bearing in mind Paragraph E19; there should be no significant leakage."
1938_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The test should be allowed to continue for at least 5 minutes.
1939_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The closures at the top and bottom of the flue should then be removed.
1940_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Smoke test II
1941_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,All doors and windows in the room served by the flue should be closed.
1942_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The flue should first be warmed to establish a draught.
1943_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A suitable flue-testing smoke pellet is ignited at the base of the flue or in the intended position of the appliance, so that the smoke is drawn into the flue with the rising draught."
1944_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"(If the pellets are placed in a recess at the base of the flue, the opening between the room and the recess should be partially closed, such as with a board, but so as to leave an air entry gap of about 25mm at the bottom.)"
1945_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Smoke should be seen to issue freely from the flue outlet or terminal and not to spill back into the room.
1946_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,There should be no significant leakage of smoke from the length of the chimney inside or outside of the building.
1947_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Smoke tests I and II are in line with the recommendations in BS 5440-1:2008.
1948_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Notes in relation to testing
1949_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Where warming of the flue is specified, this is intended to establish a draught, but this may take more than 10 minutes in the case of large or cold flues."
1950_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Appliances, where fitted, should not be under fire at the time of carrying out the test."
1951_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"During a smoke test, smoke should not emerge from the outlet of any other flue, as this indicates leakage between flues."
1952_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"When checking for smoke leakage from a flue, it should be borne in mind that smoke from a faulty flue can emerge some distance away from the original fault."
1953_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In such cases, the smoke could emerge from such places as barge overhangs in the end of terrace dwellings or from window reveals in cavity walls."
1954_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems Approved Document JONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION APPENDIX E E20 The purpose of carrying out smoke testing is to check that flue gases will rise freely through the flue and to identify whether there are any faults, such as incorrectly sealed joints or damage that would cause the flue gases to escape into the dwelling."
1955_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,It should be noted that smoke pellets E21 create a pressure significantly higher than the pressure required in the product standards for natural draught chimneys and for flues having a gas-tightness designation of N1.
1956_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Flues to this designation are permitted to have a leakage rate of up to 2 litre/s/m² flue wall area.
1957_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Some smoke leakage may therefore be seen during smoke tests and it can be a matter of expert judgement of whether leakage indicates failure.
1958_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, wisps of smoke visible on the outside of the chimney or near joints between chimney sections do not necessarily indicate a fault."
1959_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"If forceful plumes, or large volumes of smoke are seen, this could indicate a major fault such as an incorrectly made connection or joint, or a damaged section of chimney that requires investigation and remedial action followed by a repeat of the test."

1963_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Failure to implement even a few of these F3 measures will typically mean that the overall air permeability will probably exceed 5.0 m3/(h.m2) at 50 Pa.
1964_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"However, individual rooms in some older houses with solid walls and solid floors can be inherently air-tight when fitted with modern glazing."
1965_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The situation may therefore need to be assessed with respect both to the overall dwelling and to the individual room where the appliance is to be fitted.
1966_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,If in doubt then assume that the air permeability is lower than 5.0 m3/
1967_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,at 50 Pa and fit the appropriate permanent ventilation or seek specialist advice.

1969_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Improving airtightness in dwellings.
1970_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The minimum requirements for permanent F1 ventilation for certain appliances depend on a knowledge of the air-tightness of the dwelling where they are to be installed, Dwellings built after 2008 are likely to have evidence of the air-tightness either through an individual air permeability test certificate or through representative testing of the same design of dwelling on the same housing development."
1971_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Older houses are unlikely to have been F2 tested but are unlikely to achieve an air permeability of less than 5.0 m3/(h.m2) at 50 Pa unless the building fabric has been substantially upgraded.
1972_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,That would include all or most of the following measures:
1973_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• Full double (or triple) glazing
1974_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• Effective closures on trickle vents and other controllable ventilation devices
1975_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• All external doors with integral draught seals and letter box seals
1976_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,• Internal and external sealing around external doors and window frames

1990_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,J Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems Approved Document JONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Appendix G: European chimney designations This informative appendix provides a G1 summary of the European chimney designation scheme.
1991_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The essence of the scheme is a series of code letters based on the general chimney designation scheme of BS EN 1443:2003, an example of which and their explanation is given below."
1992_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Designation
1993_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The designation of a chimney consists of :
1994_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Chimney EN 1234 – T 450 N2 D 1 G50
1995_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Number of corresponding chimney standard
1996_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Temperature class Pressure class N or P or H Resistance to condensate class, W (wet) or D (dry) Corrosion resistance class"
1997_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Sootfire resistance class G or O followed by distance to combustible materials
1998_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"European chimney standards have been G3 developed based on the material of the flue liner e.g. clay/ceramic, concrete, metal, and plastic."
1999_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Some material based standards have adopted a different shortened designation e.g. for clay flue liners a designation Liner – EN 1457-300-A1-N2 means it is suitable for a chimney with the designation T600 N2 D 3 G, with a nominal size of 300mm."
2000_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The designation of the corrosion G4 resistance class of a metal chimney product is dealt with in BS EN 1856-1 and BS EN 1856-2 by a two-fold approach.
2001_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"A minimum material specification and thickness is allowed which is dependent on that which is permitted in member states regulations, where these exist."
2002_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Products upon which a declaration has been made in this manner are designated Vm.
2003_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The alternative approach involves the choice of one of three corrosion resistance tests.
2004_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Products meeting the tests carry the designation V1, V2 or V3, as appropriate allow the product to be designated with the Corrosion resistance class 1, 2, or 3 respectively."
2005_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The material specification still forms part of the overall designation, and appears alongside the ‘V’ letter, e.g. Vx-L40045."
2006_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The material specification for the liner (or connecting pipe) is formed by the letter ‘L’ followed by five digits.
2007_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,The first two digits represent the material type and the last three digits represent the material thickness in multiples of 0.01mm.
2008_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"For the UK, guidance on the minimum G5 material specification appropriate for the various applications in terms of corrosion resistance (solid fuel, gas and oil) is given in the UK National Annex to BS EN 1856-1 and -2."
2009_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,For further examples of shortened designation refer to the specific product standards.
2010_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"In selecting an appliance for a given G6 chimney designation, the appliance, irrespective of the fuel used, is required to generate combustion products with characteristics equal or less than those designated for the chimney."
2011_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"When selecting a chimney suitable for a given appliance, any chimney with performance characteristics equal to or higher than those appropriate for the appliance may be used."
2012_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,Temperature classes
2013_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Temperature classes are set out in Table G7 G1 and expressed as ‘T’ followed by a number which is less than or equal to the nominal working temperature, i.e., the average flue gas temperature obtained during the nominal/"

2040_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"Pressure classes are set out in Table G2 G8 and expressed as either ‘N’, ‘P’ or ‘H’ followed by either ‘1’ or ‘2’."
2041_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,N relates in general to natural draught chimneys i.e. operating under negative pressure where the value 1 or 2 allows for a different class of product; metal chimneys to BS EN 1856-1 have the class N1.
2042_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,In the UK the value N2 will be assigned as a minimum to masonry chimneys.
2043_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,P and H relate to chimneys which operate under positive pressure e.g. for fan assisted applications and diesel generators respectively.
2044_UK_UK_Approved_Document_J,"The pressure designation depends on the gas tightness it achieves, the lower number being the more onerous, the higher allowed leakage for positive pressure application being intended to external installations."
