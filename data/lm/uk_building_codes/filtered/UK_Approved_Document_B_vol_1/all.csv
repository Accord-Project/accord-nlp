407_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Introduction
408_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Separate guidance applies to means of escape within the flat and within the common parts of the building that lead to a place of safety.
409_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Flats at ground level are treated similarly to dwellinghouses.
410_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"With increasing height, more complex provisions are needed."
411_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,The provisions in this section make the following assumptions.
412_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Any fire is likely to be in a flat.
413_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,There is no reliance on external rescue.
414_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Simultaneous evacuation of all flats is unlikely to be necessary due to compartmentation.
415_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Fires in common parts of the building should not spread beyond the fabric in the immediate vicinity.
416_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"In some cases, however, communal facilities exist that require additional measures to be taken."
417_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Provisions are recommended to support a stay put evacuation strategy for blocks of flats.
418_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,It is based on the principle that a fire is contained in the flat of origin and common escape routes are maintained relatively free from smoke and heat.
419_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"It allows occupants, some of whom may require assistance to escape in the event of a fire, in other flats that are not affected to remain."
420_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Sufficient protection to common means of escape is necessary to allow occupants to escape should they choose to do so or are instructed/aided to by the fire service.
421_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,A higher standard of protection is therefore needed to ensure common escape routes remain available for a longer period than is provided in other buildings.
422_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Paragraphs 3.6 to 3.23 deal with the means of escape within each flat.
423_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Paragraphs 3.25 to 3.89 deal with the means of escape in common areas of the building (including mixed use buildings in paragraphs 3.76 and 3.77).
424_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Guidance for live/work units is given in paragraph 3.24.
425_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,General provisions
426_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Mixed use buildings
427_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"In mixed use buildings, separate means of escape should be provided from any storeys or parts of storeys used for the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose groups 1, 2 and 5), other than in the case of certain small buildings or buildings in which the residential accommodation is ancillary (see paragraphs 3.76 and 3.77)"

2401_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Introduction
2402_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,The external wall of a building should not provide a medium for fire spread if that is likely to be a risk to health and safety.
2403_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"Combustible materials and cavities in external walls and attachments to them can present such a risk, particularly in tall buildings."
2404_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,The guidance in this section is designed to reduce the risk of fire spread as well as the risk of ignition from flames coming from adjacent buildings.
2405_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Fire resistance

2761_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Portal frames are often used in single storey industrial and commercial buildings where there may be no need for fire resistance of the structure (requirement B3).
2762_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"However, where a portal framed building is near a relevant boundary, the external wall near the boundary may need fire resistance to restrict the spread of fire between buildings."
2763_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"It is generally accepted that a portal frame acts as a single structural element because of the moment-resisting connections used, especially at the column/rafter joints."
2764_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"Thus, in cases where the external wall of the building cannot be wholly unprotected, the rafter members of the frame, as well as the column members, may need to be fire protected."
2765_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,The design method for this is set out in SCI Publication P313.
2766_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,NOTE:
2767_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,The recommendations in the SCI publication for designing the foundation to resist overturning do not need to be followed if the building is fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.

3324_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Provision of smoke outlets
3325_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Heat and smoke from basement fires vented via stairs can inhibit access for firefighting personnel.
3326_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"This may be reduced by providing smoke outlets, or smoke vents, which allow heat and smoke to escape from the basement levels to the open air."
3327_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,They can also be used by the fire and rescue service to let cooler air into the basements (Diagram 16.1).

3329_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"Where this is not practicable (for example, the plan area is deep and the amount of external wall is restricted by adjoining buildings), the perimeter basement spaces may be vented, with other spaces vented indirectly by opening connecting doors."
3330_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,This does not apply for places of special fire hazard (see paragraph 16.7).
3331_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"If a basement is compartmented, each compartment should have one or more smoke outlets, rather than indirect venting."

3341_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,The combined clear cross-sectional area of all smoke outlets should be a minimum of 1/40 of the area of the floor of the storey they serve.
3342_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,Separate outlets should be provided from places of special fire hazard.
3343_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"If the smoke outlet terminates at a point that is not readily accessible, it should be kept unobstructed and covered only with a class A1 grille or louvre."
3344_UK_UK_Approved_Document_B_vol_1,"If the smoke outlet terminates in a readily accessible position, it may be covered by a panel, stallboard or pavement light that can be broken out or opened."
