413_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,The provisions of Section 2A apply only where a planning condition requires compliance with optional requirement M4(2) for accessible and adaptable dwellings (see paragraphs 0.3 to 0.6).
414_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,The provisions of Section 2A apply to external and internal areas and elements that form part of the approach route to the individual dwelling and fall within the plot (or curtilage) of the dwelling or the building containing the dwelling.
415_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"The provisions also apply to the approach route between the dwelling and the point, or points, at which an occupant or visitor, including a disabled person, would expect to get in and out of a car."
416_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"This point, or points, of access may be within or outside the plot of the dwelling or the building containing the dwelling (typically a block of flats)."
417_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,These provisions do not apply beyond the curtilage of the development.
418_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,Reasonable provision should be made to ensure that the approach route to any communal facilities that serve the dwelling meets these provisions.
419_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"Communal facilities include storage areas, such as those used for depositing refuse and recycling, but not plant rooms or other service areas unless occupants need regular access, for example for meter reading."
420_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"For a house (or other dwelling that sits within its own plot) the approach route will often only involve a driveway, or a gate and a path, but for a dwelling within a larger building (typically a block of flats) the approach route will usually involve one, or more, communal gates, paths, entrances, doors, lobbies, corridors and access decks, as well as communal lifts and stairs."

422_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"General 2.6 The approach route should be safe and convenient, adopt the shallowest gradient that can reasonably be achieved and be step-free, irrespective of the storey on which the dwelling is located."
423_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"Where it is not reasonable to achieve a step-free approach route to the principal private entrance, a step-free approach route should be provided to a suitable alternative private entrance instead."
424_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,The provisions for approach routes (other than those relating specifically to step-free access) should still apply to both the route to the principal private entrance and the route to the alternative private entrance.
425_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"Where a communal ramped approach route is provided and has an overall rise of 300mm or more, an additional stepped route meeting the requirements of paragraph 2.11 should also be provided."

1548_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,Reasonable provision will vary depending on whether dwellings are wheelchair adaptable or wheelchair accessible.
1549_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"To provide suitable and convenient sanitary facilities, a dwelling should comply with all of the following."
1550_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"WC facilities are provided which comply with the relevant requirements of paragraphs 3.37 to 3.40, and bathroom facilities are provided which comply with the relevant requirements of paragraphs 3.41 to 3.43."
1551_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,Any dwelling with four or more bedspaces provides access to a minimum of two WCs in separate bathrooms or WC/cloakrooms (see Table 3.5).
1552_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,Every room that contains an installed level access shower is constructed as a wet room.
1553_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"All walls, ducts and boxings to every WC/cloakroom, bath and shower room are strong enough to support grab rails, seats and other adaptations that could impose a load of 1.5kN/m2."
1554_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,The ceiling structure to bathrooms and WC/cloakrooms required by paragraphs 3.36 to 3.40 is strong enough to allow for the fitting of an overhead hoist capable of carrying a load of 200kg.
1555_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"Where sanitary facilities are wheelchair accessible, WC flush controls are positioned on the front of the cistern on the transfer side and can be easily gripped, e.g. a lever flush handle."

1557_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,"Where sanitary facilities are wheelchair accessible, basins and sinks should be wall hung (typically with their rim 770-850mm above finished floor level) and the clear zone beneath basins, services and pedestals is maximised to enable wheelchair users to approach."
1558_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,Ideally this clear zone should be in the range 400-600mm from finished floor level.
1559_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,Stacks or soil and vent pipes should only be positioned adjacent to WC where there is no practical alternative and should always be on the wall side of the WC.
1560_UK_UK_Approved_Document_M_vol_1,NOTE 1: The loading for strengthened walls is considered suitable for many types of adaptations but additional localised strengthening may be required if adaptations are fitted that impose high point loads.
