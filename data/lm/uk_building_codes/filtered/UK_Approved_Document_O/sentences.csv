40_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"A unit that contains both living accommodation and space for commercial purposes (e.g. as a workshop or office) should be treated as a residential building, as long as the commercial part can revert to residential use."
41_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,The commercial part of a building can revert to residential use if all of the following apply.
42_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,There is direct access between the commercial space and the residential accommodation.
43_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,The commercial space and the residential accommodation are within the same thermal envelope.
44_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,The residential accommodation comprises a substantial proportion of the total area of the unit.
45_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,What constitutes a ‘substantial proportion’ should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the building control body.
47_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,A large non-residential building that contains a small flat for a manager is not treated as a residential building.
48_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,A residential building that contains a room used as an office or utility space is still treated as a residential building.
49_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,Mixed-use developments 0.7 The guidance in this approved document applies only to the parts of a mixed-use building that are for residential purposes and any corridor that serves residential units.
51_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,The guidance in this approved document is the suggested approach to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations.
52_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,Alternative approaches are possible but they should be discussed and agreed with a building control body before building work starts.
53_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"The legal requirements of the Building Regulations must be met, regardless of whether the guidance in this approved document is followed or alternative measures are taken."
54_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"If alternative ways of mitigating overheating are adopted, the overall level of overheating risk reduction should not be lower than the approved document provides."
55_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,It is the responsibility of those undertaking the work to demonstrate compliance.
57_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"The approved documents set out what, in ordinary circumstances, may be accepted as one way to comply with the Building Regulations."
58_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"It remains the responsibility of those designing or undertaking building work to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether specific circumstances require additional or alternative measures to achieve compliance with the regulatory requirements."
59_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,There are interactions between many of the requirements of the Building Regulations and the following paragraphs provide guidance on some key interactions.
62_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"This approved document, Approved Document O, gives guidance on window openings for removing excess heat from residential buildings."
63_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,Approved Document B gives guidance on the size of escape windows.

66_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"This approved document, Approved Document O, includes guidance on providing means of removing excess heat from residential buildings."
67_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"Where openings are used, the amount of ventilation for removing excess heat is likely to be higher than the purge ventilation required for Part F. The higher amount of ventilation applies – see Section 1 or Section 2 of this approved document, depending on the method of compliance."
69_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,Ventilation fans might cause combustion gases to spill from open-flued appliances and fill the room instead of going up the flue or chimney.
70_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,This can occur even if the combustion appliance and fan are in separate rooms.
71_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,The guidance in Approved Document J should be followed when installing and testing ventilation appliances and combustion appliances must operate safely whether or not fans are running.
73_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,Solar gains in winter can reduce the amount of space heating required to be delivered by the heating system.
74_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,Reducing summer overheating by limiting glazing areas will impact winter solar gains and therefore increase the need for space heating.
75_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"Poorly insulated pipework, particularly in community heating schemes, can be a major contributor to overheating."
76_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,Control of heat losses from pipework is dealt with under Part L of the Building Regulations and the guidance in Approved Document L should be followed.

374_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"For example, horizontal bars should generally be avoided."
376_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,To ensure safe operation it may be necessary to reduce the size of the outward opening windows and provide more windows to meet the required free area.
386_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,"This approved document has increased levels of protection from falling compared to Approved Document K. Where applicable, the higher standard applies."
387_UK_UK_Approved_Document_O,Guarding should be sized to prevent the passage of a 100mm sphere.
