7_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"without causing such deflection or deformation of any part of the building, or such movement of the ground, as will impair the stability of any part of another building."
8_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,In assessing whether a building complies with sub-paragraph (1) regard shall be had to the imposed and wind loads to which it is likely to be subjected in the ordinary course of its use for the purpose for which it is intended.
9_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Ground movement
10_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,The building shall be constructed so that ground movement caused by:
11_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"swelling, shrinkage or freezing of the subsoil; or"
12_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"land-slip or subsidence (other than subsidence arising from shrinkage), in so far as the risk can be reasonably foreseen, will not impair the stability of any part of the building."

14_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Approved Document A StructureONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 0.3 Grandstands and structures erected in places of public assembly may need to sustain the synchronous or rhythmic movement of numbers of people.
15_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,It is important to ensure that the design of the structure takes these factors into account so as to avoid the structure being impaired or causing alarm to people using the structure.
16_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"Guidance on the design and testing of grandstands may be found in ‘Dynamic performance requirements for permanent grandstands subject to crowd action – Recommendations for management, design and assessment’ published by The Institution of Structural Engineers, December 2008."

18_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Guidance
19_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Introduction 0.1 In the Secretary of State’s view the requirements of A1 and A2 will be met by following the recommendations given in the documents listed in Section 1 or by adopting the guidance in Sections 2-4:
20_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"Section 1 is relevant to all building types and lists Codes, Standards and other references for structural design and construction but, where they do not give precise guidance, consideration should be given to paragraph 0.2."
21_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Section 2 give sizes of structural elements for certain residential buildings and other small buildings of traditional construction.
22_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Section 3 gives guidance on the support and fixing of wall cladding.
23_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Section 4 gives guidance where roofs are to be re-covered as a material alteration as defined in the Regulations.
24_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"The safety of a structure depends on the 0.2 successful combination of design and completed construction, particularly:"
25_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,The design should be based on identification of the hazards to which the structure is likely to be subjected and assessment of the risks.
26_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,The selection of relevant critical situations for design should be made reflecting the conditions that can reasonably be foreseen during future use.
27_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Loading.
28_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"Dead load, imposed load and wind load should be in accordance with the current Codes of practice referred to in Section 1 of this document."
29_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Properties of materials.
30_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Detailed design and assembly of the structure.
31_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Safety factors.
32_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Workmanship.
33_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"The numeric values of safety factors, whether expressed explicitly or implicitly in design equations, or design values, should be derived from considerations of the above aspects of design and construction as a whole."
34_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,A change in any one of these aspects may disturb the safety of the structure.
35_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"Loads used in calculations should allow for possible dynamic, concentrated and peak load effects that may occur."

224_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"Only the types of wall given in Table 2, which must extend to the full storey height, and parapet walls are considered in this section."
225_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,The use of this section
226_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,When using this section it should be noted that:
227_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,this section must be used in conjunction with section 2A;
228_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"if wall thickness is to be determined according to paragraphs 2C5 to 2C13, all appropriate design conditions given in this section must be satisfied;"
229_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"walls should comply with the relevant requirements of BS EN 1996-2:2006 with its UK National Annex and additional guidance given in BSI Published Document PD 6697:2010, except as regards the conditions given in paragraphs 2C4 and 2C14 to 2C38;"
230_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,in formulating the guidance of this section the worst combination of circumstances likely to arise was taken into account.
231_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"If a requirement of this part is considered too onerous in a particular case it may be appropriate to consider a minor departure on the basis of judgement and experience, or to show adequacy by calculation in respect of the aspect of the wall which is subject to the departure rather than for the entire wall;"
232_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,the guidance given is based upon the compressive strengths of bricks and blocks being not less than indicated in Tables 6 and 7.
233_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,BS EN 1996-1-1:2005 with its UK National Annex gives design strengths for walls where the suitability for use of masonry units of other compressive strengths is being considered.

1071_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,1:2002 with its UK National Annex.
1072_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Transparent or translucent covering materials for roofs not accessible except for normal maintenance and repair are excluded from the requirement to carry the concentrated imposed load upon roofs if they are non-fragile or are otherwise suitably protected against collapse.
1073_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,The re-covering of roofs is commonly Re-covering of roofs
1074_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,undertaken to extend the useful life of buildings.
1075_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Roof structures may be required to carry underdrawing or insulation provided at a time later than their initial construction.
1076_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,This section provides guidance on determining whether such work to a roof constitutes a material alteration under the Building Regulations.
1077_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Where the work involves a significant change in the applied loading the structural integrity of the roof structure and the supporting structure should be checked to ensure that upon completion of the work the building is not less compliant with Requirement A1 than the original building.
1078_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,A significant change in roof loading is 4.4 when the loading upon the roof is increased by more than 15%.
1079_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Consideration might also be given to whether the roof covering being replaced is the original as-built covering.
1080_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"Where such checking of the existing roof structure indicates that the construction is unable to sustain any proposed increase in loading (e.g. due to overstressed members or unacceptable deflection leading to ponding), appropriate strengthening work or replacement of roofing members should be undertaken."
1081_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,This is classified as a material alteration.
1082_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,In carrying out the checks mentioned in 4.6 paragraph 4.3 an increase of stress in a structural member arising from increased loading does not necessarily indicate that the roof structure is less compliant than the original roof provided an adequate factor of safety is maintained.
1083_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"Where work will significantly decrease the roof dead loading, the roof structure and its anchorage to the supporting structure should be checked to ensure that an adequate factor of safety is maintained against uplift of the roof under imposed wind loading."

1100_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"The requirement will be met by adopting the following approach for ensuring that the building is sufficiently robust to sustain a limited extent of damage or failure, depending on the consequence class of the building, without collapse."
1101_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Determine the building’s consequence class from Table 11.
1102_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"For Consequence Class 1 buildings – Provided the building has been designed and constructed in accordance with the rules given in this Approved Document, or other guidance referenced under Section 1, for meeting compliance with Requirement A1 and A2 in normal use, no additional measures are likely to be necessary."
1103_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"For Consequence Class 2a buildings – In addition to the Consequence Class 1 measures, provide effective horizontal ties, or effective anchorage of suspended floors to walls, as described in the Standards listed under paragraph 5.2 for framed and load-"

1106_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,"Alternatively, check that upon the notional removal of each supporting column and each beam supporting one or more columns, or any nominal length of load-bearing wall (one at a time in each storey of the building), the building remains stable and that the area of floor at any storey at risk of collapse does not exceed 15% of the floor area of that storey or 100m2, whichever is smaller, and does not extend further than the immediate adjacent storeys (see Diagram 24)."
1107_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,Critical situations for design should be selected that reflect the conditions that can reasonably be foreseen as possible during the life of the building.
1108_UK_UK_Approved_Document_A,The structural form and concept and any protective measures should then be chosen and the detailed design of the structure and its elements undertaken in accordance with the recommendations given in the Standards given in paragraph 5.2.
