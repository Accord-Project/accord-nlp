28_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,See paragraph 1.5 for types of building and building work that are exempt.
29_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"Requirement R1 does not apply where requirement RA1 applies, e.g. when a new dwelling or a building containing one or more dwellings is erected."
30_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"Requirement R1 is to provide the in-building physical infrastructure so that, in future, copper or fibre-optic cables or wireless devices capable of delivering broadband speeds greater than 30 Mbps can be installed."
31_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,NOTE:
32_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"A standard copper telephone cable, when connected to a service provider’s fibre network, can deliver broadband speeds up to 70 Mbps."
33_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"The requirement is to provide only the in-building physical infrastructure, from the service provider’s access point to the occupier’s network termination point."
34_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Multi-dwelling buildings that are subject to major renovation works must be equipped with a common access point capable of serving all the dwellings within the building.
35_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"It is not a requirement to provide any network cabling or equipment, or any in-building physical infrastructure that extends internally beyond the network termination point."
36_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Nor is it a requirement to provide any external or site-wide infrastructure beyond the access point or common access point.
37_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,The developer and broadband service provider should agree who will install such external infrastructure.
38_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Application
39_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Requirement R1 does not apply to the following types of building or building work.
40_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,The erection of a new dwelling described in requirements RA1 and RA2 for gigabit-ready physical infrastructure and gigabit-capable connections (see Approved Document R Volume 1: Physical infrastructure and network connection for new dwellings).
41_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,A new dwelling may be a dwelling-
42_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,house or a flat in a building that contains one or more dwellings.
43_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Dwellings include the following:
44_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,new housing developments
45_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,self-build new dwellings
46_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"new dwellings in mixed-use developments (including live/work units, e.g. a flat (dwelling) that is a workplace for people who live there, and for people who do not live there)."
47_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"Buildings and work described in Classes 2 to 7 of Schedule 2 (Exempt buildings and work) to the Building Regulations – for example, sheds, domestic greenhouses, garages, conservatories and other small detached buildings with no sleeping accommodation."

50_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Buildings for which compliance with requirement R1 would unacceptably alter their character or appearance and that are either of the following:
51_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,listed in accordance with section 1 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990
52_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,in a conservation area designated in accordance with section 69 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.
53_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"Buildings occupied by the Ministry of Defence or the armed forces of the Crown, or otherwise occupied for purposes connected to national security."
54_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Buildings in isolated areas where the prospect of a high-speed connection is considered too remote to justify equipping the building with high-speed-ready in-building physical infrastructure or an access point or common access point.
55_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"For example, areas that are so isolated that no duty is placed on a communications provider (under the Electronic Communications (Universal Service) Order 2003) to meet the full cost of installing a telephone line to the building."
56_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Major renovation works if the cost of compliance with requirement R1 would be disproportionate to the benefit gained.
57_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"A person wishing to take advantage of this exemption would need to demonstrate to a building control body that in the particular case the cost of compliance would be unreasonable, taking into account the work required and the available alternative means of high-speed broadband delivery."
58_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Ductwork for copper and fibre-optic cables
59_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"A suitable position for at least one network termination point should be identified for the erection of a new building other than a dwelling, for an existing building (including an existing individual dwelling) that is subject to major renovation works, and for each dwelling in an existing multi-dwelling building that is subject to major renovation works."
60_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Suitable ducting should be provided to connect all such network termination points to an appropriate access point or common access point.
61_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,Diagram 11 shows a possible arrangement for the physical infrastructure for a single-occupancy building.
62_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,The access point is on an outside wall and is connected by a through-wall duct2 to a network termination point.
63_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"The diagrams show underground ducts for network cables outside the building, but this does not preclude the use of overhead lines."
64_UK_UK_Approved_Document_R_vol_2,"For copper cables, the duct may simply be a hole drilled in the wall."
