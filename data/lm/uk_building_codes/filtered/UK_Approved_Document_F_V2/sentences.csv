675_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,This appendix sets out the levels of moisture and other pollutants that the provisions in this approved document are designed to control.
676_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The provisions are designed to control all of the following.
677_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Bio-effluents, as described in paragraph B2a."
678_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Moisture levels, as described in paragraph B2b."
679_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Indoor air pollutants, as described in paragraph B2d."
681_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The guidance in this approved document may not be adequate to address pollutants from flueless combustion space heaters.
682_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,This approved document does not directly address contamination from outdoor sources.
684_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,A strategy for achieving good indoor air quality includes reducing the release of water vapour and air pollutants.
685_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,This approved document does not provide guidance on such strategies.
687_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The main guidance within this approved document focuses on offices.
688_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The main performance criteria applied are as follows.
689_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"There should be a supply rate, in the absence of tobacco smoke or other excessive pollutants, of 10 litres per second per person."
690_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,This will also satisfy the requirement of 8 litres per second per person needed to control higher levels of bio-effluents.
691_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,There should be no visible mould on the inner surfaces of external walls of a properly heated building with typical moisture generation.
692_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Mould can grow whether the building is occupied or unoccupied, so the performance criteria for surface water activity (as given in Table B2) should be met at all times, regardless of whether there are occupants."
693_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The other pollutants listed in Table B1 are only of concern when the building is occupied.
694_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The performance criteria for indoor air pollutants are given in Table B1.
731_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,No safe levels can be recommended for benzene or trichloroethylene so they have not been considered in the definition of ventilation rates in buildings.
732_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The best strategy for reducing their concentration indoors may be to control them at source.
733_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Even if the designer and builder choose to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) levels in buildings by controlling them at source, the ventilation requirements must still be met."
734_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The total volatile organic compound (TVOC) metric is representative of all airborne indoor air VOC concentrations and should not be used as a direct indicator of health.
735_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The simplified metric is used as an indicator for the purposes of ventilation control strategies.
736_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"As an alternative to the TVOC limit, individual VOC limits may be used where justified in accordance with the guidance in paragraph B3."
737_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"As an alternative to using TVOC, the individual VOCs may be applied where their use is supported by robust independent evidence."
738_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,Public Health England’s Indoor Air Quality Guidelines for Selected Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the UK should be used.
739_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,Testing against these metrics is likely to be more complex than testing against TVOC.
740_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Where the Health and Safety Executive gives guidance for specific situations, that guidance should be followed in preference to the guidance given here."
744_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"For the purposes of this approved document, for all offices (both new and existing, where Part F applies), the moisture criteria are likely to be met if, during the colder months of the year, the moving average surface water activity of the internal surfaces of external walls is always less than the value in Table B2, evaluated over each moving average period."
755_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Office equipment can emit pollutants, including ozone and organic compounds."
756_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"For example, a study by Black and Wortham (1999) suggests the following emission rates for laser printers and dry paper copiers assuming 30 minutes use in an hour."
757_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,25mg/h for TVOC.
758_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,3mg/h for ozone.
759_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,To meet the performance criteria for these pollutants requires an extract rate of 20 litres per second per machine during use.
760_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"For sanitary accommodation, the extract rates used for dwellings have been applied."
761_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"For food and beverage preparation areas, the extract rates used for dwellings have been applied."
765_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The guidance in this appendix is based on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) EMG/SPI-B advisory group paper Application of CO2 monitoring as an approach to managing ventilation to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
766_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,People exhale carbon dioxide (CO2) when they breathe out.
767_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,If there is a build-up of CO2 in an area it can indicate that ventilation needs to be improved.
768_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,Checking levels of CO2 using a monitor can help to identify areas that are poorly ventilated.
770_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,Many different types of CO2 monitor are available.
771_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The most appropriate portable devices for use in the workplace are non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 monitors.
772_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,How to use a CO2 monitor
773_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The level of CO2 in the air will vary within an indoor space.
774_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"It is best to place CO2 monitors at head height and away from windows, doors or air supply openings."
775_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,Monitors that are positioned too close to people may give a misleadingly high reading due to the CO2 in exhaled breath.
776_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,Monitors should therefore be positioned at least 500mm away from room occupants.
777_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Measured levels of CO2 within a space can vary throughout the day due to changes in number of occupants, activities being performed or ventilation rates in the space."
778_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The opening and closing of doors and windows can also have an effect.
779_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The amount of CO2 in the air is measured in parts per million (ppm).
780_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"If measurements in an occupied space seem very low (far below 400ppm) or very high (over 1500ppm), it is possible that the monitor is not in a suitable location."
781_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"The monitor may need to be moved to another position within the space, to get a more accurate reading."
782_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Instantaneous or ‘snapshot’ CO2 readings can be misleading, so several measurements should be taken throughout the day."
783_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,The frequency of measurements should be sufficient to ensure that changes in the use of the room or space throughout the day are represented in the readings.
784_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Levels of CO2 may also vary throughout the year, as outdoor temperatures, and therefore behaviour relating to opening windows and doors, change."
786_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,Check that monitors are within the recommended calibration period.
788_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Know how to use the monitor correctly, including the time needed to provide a reading."
789_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,Take measurements at key times throughout the working day.
790_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"Record CO2 readings, number of occupants, the type of ventilation in use at the time and the date."
791_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,These will help you use the CO2 records to decide if an area is poorly ventilated.
794_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"CO2 measurements should be used as a broad guide to ventilation within a space, rather than treated as ‘safe thresholds’."
795_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,Outdoor levels are around 400ppm.
796_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,A consistent indoor CO2 value of less than 800ppm is likely to indicate that a space is well ventilated.
797_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,An average CO2 concentration of 1500ppm over the period when a space is occupied is an indicator of poor ventilation.
798_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,Action should be taken to improve ventilation if CO2 readings are consistently higher than 1500ppm.
799_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"However, in locations where continuous talking or singing takes place, or there are high levels of physical activity (such as dancing, playing sport or exercising), providing ventilation sufficient to keep CO2 levels below 800ppm is recommended."
801_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,CO2 monitors may not be suitable for use in areas that rely on air-cleaning units because these remove contaminants from the air but do not remove CO2.
802_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,"In large, open spaces and spaces with high ceilings, such as food production halls or warehouses, air may not be fully mixed and the measurements made by CO2 monitors may not be representative."
803_UK_UK_Approved_Document_F_V2,CO2 monitors are of limited use in less populated areas.
