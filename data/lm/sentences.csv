Regulation 7 of the Building Regulations This approved document gives guidance on how to meet regulation 7 of the Building Regulations 2010.
Building work shall be carried out with adequate and proper materials which
"are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used,"
"are adequately mixed or prepared, and"
"are applied, used or fixed so as adequately to perform the functions for which they are designed; and"
in a workmanlike manner.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, you will meet the requirements of regulation 7 if you satisfy both of the following conditions."
Materials are of a suitable nature and quality in relation to the purposes and conditions of their use.
"Workmanship is such that, where relevant, materials are adequately mixed or prepared and applied, used or fixed so as to perform adequately the functions for which they are intended."
"naturally occurring materials such as stone, timber and thatch"
backfilling for excavations in connection with building work.
Regulation 7 applies to all building work.
"However, in accordance with regulation 8 and Schedule 1, the standards of materials and workmanship need be no more than are necessary to: "
"for Parts A–D, F–K, N and P (except for paragraphs G2, H2 and J7) of Schedule 1: secure reasonable standards of health or safety for people in or about the building"
for Part E of Schedule 1: secure reasonable resistance to the passage of sound for the welfare and convenience of people in or about the building
for Part L of Schedule 1: conserve fuel and power
for Part M of Schedule 1: provide access to buildings and their facilities for people.
Building work must meet the functional requirements of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations.
"Approved documents refer to materials covered by harmonised European product standards, British Standards and other technical specifications."
"However, there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an approved document in order to meet functional requirements; the references are not exclusive and other materials may be suitable in the particular circumstances."
"You can assess the suitability of a material for use for a specific purpose in a number of ways, as described in paragraphs 1.3 to 1.21."
Many materials are construction products that have CE marking under the Construction Products Regulation (305/2011/EU-CPR).
The Construction Products Regulation requires that construction products on the EU market covered by a harmonised European product standard should normally have CE marking.
"In addition, manufacturers of products not covered by a harmonised standard can choose to affix CE marking to their products by obtaining a European Technical Assessment."
You can find a list of the harmonised product standards under the Construction Products Regulation on the NANDO information system website at http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/nando/index.cfm?fuseaction=cpd.hs.
CE marking includes the reference of the product standard and the levels or classes of performance being declared against some or all of the characteristics covered by the standard.
"The CE marking should be on the product, its label, the packaging or accompanying documents."
The CE symbol by itself does not necessarily indicate that the material is suitable for the building work.
"In addition to CE marking, the product will have a declaration of performance containing more detailed information on the product."
"This may be a paper or electronic document, or it may be on a website."
It is essential to check that the declared performance is suitable for the building works.
"In the absence of indications to the contrary, the building control body should assume that the information given in the CE marking and declaration of performance is accurate and reliable, and that the product meets the declared performance."
"If the declared performance of a product is suitable for its intended use, the building control body should not prohibit or impede the use of the product."
CE marking under other EU directives and regulations 1.8 Products may have CE marking under European legislation such as the Gas Appliances Directive or the Pressure Equipment Directive.
"Such CE marking shows that the product meets the essential requirements set out in the legislation – for example, minimum safety requirements – and can be placed on the EU market."
Some products have CE marking in accordance with both the Construction Products Regulation and other legislation.
The CE marking shows that the product complies with the requirements in all relevant EU legislation.
Nearly all British Standards for construction products are the British versions of harmonised European standards used for CE marking.
"The BSI numbering policy is to adopt the CEN numbering, prefaced with BS, e.g. BS EN 197-1:2000."
"Some British Standards are the British version of non-harmonised European standards; these also adopt the CEN numbering, prefaced with BS."
"These do not contain an Annex ZA, so CE marking cannot be affixed to products made to these standards."
Some British Standards for products not covered by a European standard will continue to exist.
"Where a construction product has been made and assessed in accordance with one or more British Standards referred to in 1.11 and 1.12, this may show whether the product is suitable for its intended use."
"An international technical specification, including those prepared by ISO, or a national technical specification of a country other than the UK, may be used to demonstrate that a product not covered by a harmonised European standard meets the performance requirements of the Building Regulations."
"Where necessary, the person who intends to carry out the work should obtain translations of specifications and demonstrate how the material meets the requirements of regulation 7. NOTE:"
"The national technical specifications of EU member states (and non-EU countries that are full members of CEN) are being progressively replaced by harmonised European standards, as is the case with British Standards."
There are many independent product certification schemes in the UK and elsewhere that may provide information on the performance of a product.
Such schemes certify that a material complies with the requirements of a recognised document and indicates it is suitable for its intended purpose and use.
"These may be in addition to, but not conflict with, CE marking."
Materials which are not certified by an independent scheme might still conform to a relevant standard.
Accreditation of a certification body by a national accreditation body belonging to the European co-operation for Accreditation (EA) provides a means of demonstrating that their certification scheme can be relied upon.
"In the UK, most independent certification bodies are accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS), which belongs to the EA."
"It is important to check the scope of the accreditation of a certification body, as accreditation might cover only part of the certification body’s testing or certification business."
"Where there is no relevant harmonised European standard, tests, calculations or other means may be used to demonstrate that the material can perform the function for which it is intended."
UKAS or an equivalent national accreditation body belonging to the EA may accredit the testing laboratories; this accreditation provides a means of showing that tests can be relied on.
"Past experience, such as use in an existing building, may show that the material can perform the function for which it is intended."
"Under regulation 46 of the Building Regulations, local authorities have the power to take samples as necessary to establish whether materials to be used in building work comply with the provisions of the regulations."
Regulation 46 does not apply to any work specified in an initial notice or to any work for which a final certificate has been given by an approved inspector and accepted by the local authority.
"Regulations 2010 provides that an approved inspector, having given an initial notice which continues to be in force, may take samples of material as are reasonable to establish within the limits of professional skill and care that regulation 7 of the Building Regulations or any other applicable regulations are complied with."
"Some materials, in the absence of special care, may be considered unsuitable because of their rapid deterioration in relation to the expected life of the building."
"A short-lived material which is readily accessible for inspection, maintenance and replacement may meet the requirements of the regulations if the consequences of failure are not likely to be serious to the health or safety of people in and around the building."
"If a short-lived material is not readily accessible for inspection, maintenance and replacement, and the consequences of failure are likely to be serious for health or safety, it is unlikely that the material will meet the requirements of the regulations."
"As noted in paragraph 0.2, local authorities have the power to impose conditions on the use of short-lived materials."
The properties of some materials can change in certain environmental conditions.
These changes can affect the performance of the materials over time.
"Materials that are susceptible to changes in their properties may be used in building work and will meet the requirements of the regulations if the residual properties, including the structural properties, meet both of the following conditions."
Residual properties can be estimated at the time of their incorporation in the work.
"Residual properties are shown to be adequate for the building to perform the function for which it is intended, for the expected life of the building."
The Building Regulations restrict the use of combustible materials in the external walls of certain buildings over 18m in height.
"Refer to regulation 7(2) of the Building Regulations and to Approved Document B: volume 2, part B4 for details."
Examples of ways to establish the adequacy of workmanship are described in paragraphs 2.2 to 2.11.
"If a material has CE marking, workmanship may be specified in the relevant European Technical Assessment or harmonised product standard."
Methods of carrying out different types of work are also given in British Standards or other appropriate technical specifications.
The BS 8000 series of standards on workmanship on building sites combines guidance from other BSI codes and standards.
The various parts of BS 8000 are listed in appendix B.
Some independent certification schemes specify how workmanship will deliver a declared level of performance.
The person carrying out the work should show that the workmanship will provide the appropriate level of protection and performance.
"Schemes, including competent person self-certification schemes, that register installers of materials can provide a means of ensuring that work has been carried out by knowledgeable contractors to appropriate standards."
"The quality of workmanship is covered by a quality management scheme, such as one that complies with the relevant recommendations of BS EN ISO 9000 and related series of standards."
There are a number of such UKAS-accredited schemes.
"Past experience, such as use in an existing building, may show that workmanship is appropriate for the function for which it is intended."
Tests 2.8 Tests can be used to show that workmanship is appropriate.
"In the following three instances, the Building Regulations require those carrying out building work to have testing carried out to demonstrate compliance."
Sound insulation as described in regulation 41.
Air flow rate of mechanical ventilation as described in regulation 42.
Pressure testing as described in regulation 43.
"Regulations 2010 and section 33 of the Building Act 1984, building control bodies have powers to make tests as they consider necessary to establish whether building work complies with the requirements of regulation 7. 2.11 Those carrying out building work may voluntarily include testing in the activities they carry out to demonstrate that the work complies with the requirements of the regulations."

This Approved Document deals with the following Requirements which are contained in the Building Regulations 2010.
"The building shall be constructed so that the combined dead, imposed and wind loads are sustained and transmitted by it to the ground:"
"without causing such deflection or deformation of any part of the building, or such movement of the ground, as will impair the stability of any part of another building."
In assessing whether a building complies with sub-paragraph (1) regard shall be had to the imposed and wind loads to which it is likely to be subjected in the ordinary course of its use for the purpose for which it is intended.
The building shall be constructed so that ground movement caused by:
"swelling, shrinkage or freezing of the subsoil; or"
"land-slip or subsidence (other than subsidence arising from shrinkage), in so far as the risk can be reasonably foreseen, will not impair the stability of any part of the building."
Grandstands and structures erected in places of public assembly may need to sustain the synchronous or rhythmic movement of numbers of people.
It is important to ensure that the design of the structure takes these factors into account so as to avoid the structure being impaired or causing alarm to people using the structure.
"Guidance on the design and testing of grandstands may be found in ‘Dynamic performance requirements for permanent grandstands subject to crowd action – Recommendations for management, design and assessment’ published by The Institution of Structural Engineers, December 2008."
In the Secretary of State’s view the requirements of A1 and A2 will be met by following the recommendations given in the documents listed in Section 1 or by adopting the guidance in Sections 2-4:
"Section 1 is relevant to all building types and lists Codes, Standards and other references for structural design and construction but, where they do not give precise guidance, consideration should be given to paragraph 0.2."
Section 2 give sizes of structural elements for certain residential buildings and other small buildings of traditional construction.
Section 3 gives guidance on the support and fixing of wall cladding.
Section 4 gives guidance where roofs are to be re-covered as a material alteration as defined in the Regulations.
"The safety of a structure depends on the 0.2 successful combination of design and completed construction, particularly:"
The design should be based on identification of the hazards to which the structure is likely to be subjected and assessment of the risks.
The selection of relevant critical situations for design should be made reflecting the conditions that can reasonably be foreseen during future use.
"Dead load, imposed load and wind load should be in accordance with the current Codes of practice referred to in Section 1 of this document."
Properties of materials.
Detailed design and assembly of the structure.
"The numeric values of safety factors, whether expressed explicitly or implicitly in design equations, or design values, should be derived from considerations of the above aspects of design and construction as a whole."
A change in any one of these aspects may disturb the safety of the structure.
"Loads used in calculations should allow for possible dynamic, concentrated and peak load effects that may occur."
"This section is relevant to all building types and lists codes, standards and other references for structural design and construction."
Basis of structural design and loading:
"Structural work of reinforced, 1.3 pre-stressed or plain concrete:"
Structural work of steel:
Structural work of composite steel and 1.5 concrete:
Structural work of timber:
Structural work of masonry:
Geotechnical work and foundations:
Structural work of aluminium:
"There may be known or recorded conditions of ground instability, such as that arising from landslides, disused mines or unstable strata which, if ignored, can have a devastating effect on the safety of a building and its environs."
Such conditions should be taken into account in the design of the building and its foundations.
"Attention is drawn to DOE Planning Policy Guidance Note 14 Development on unstable land (obtainable from The Stationery Office), which sets out the broad planning and technical issues relating to development on unstable land."
"The Department has also sponsored a series of reviews aimed at determining the scale and nature of problems arising from mining instability, natural underground cavities and adverse foundation conditions."
"Databases of both subsidence incidents and subsidence potential produced from these reviews are available from the following licence holders: British Geological Survey, Sir Kingsley Dunham Centre, Keyworth, Nottingham NG12 5GG."

"Compliance with Part A (Structure) is required in certain classes of change of use of a building, subject to the control of Regulations 5 and 6."
Guidance relevant to structural appraisals related to ‘change of use’ is given in the following documents:
Note: With reference to ‘design checks’ in the referenced Institution of Structural Engineers’ Technical Publication the choice of various partial factors should be made to suit the individual circumstances of each case.
"Pier A member which forms an integral part of a wall, in the form of a thickened section at intervals along the wall, so as to afford lateral support to the wall to which it is bonded or securely tied."
"Separating wall A wall or part of a wall which is common to adjoining buildings, and constructed to meet the requirements of regulation B3(2)."
"Spacing The distance between the longitudinal centres of any two adjacent timber members of the same type, measured in the plane of floor, ceiling or roof structure."
Span The distance measured along the centre line of a member between the centres of any two adjacent bearings or supports.
"Supported wall A wall to which lateral support is afforded by a combination of buttressing walls, piers or chimneys acting in conjunction with floor(s) or roof."
Wind load The load due to the effect of wind pressure or suction.
This section is presented as follows:
Basic requirements for stability.
Sizes of certain timber members in floors and roofs for dwellings.
Areas at risk from house longhorn beetle.
"Thickness of masonry walls in certain residential buildings of not more than three storeys, small single-storey non-residential buildings and annexes."
Proportions for masonry chimneys.
Foundations of plain concrete.
Section 2A gives general rules which must 2.2 be observed in following Sections 2B and 2C. Sections 2B to 2E may be used independently of each other.
Throughout this section the diagrams are only illustrative and do not show all the details of construction.
The following meanings apply to terms throughout this section:
"Buttressing wall A wall designed and constructed to afford lateral support to another wall perpendicular to it, support being provided from the base to the top of the wall."
Cavity width The horizontal distance between the two leaves of a cavity wall.
Compartment wall A wall constructed as a compartment wall to meet the requirements of regulation B3(2).
"Dead load The load due to the weight of all walls, permanent partitions, floors, roofs and finishes including services, and all other permanent construction."
"Imposed load The load assumed to be produced by the intended occupancy or use, including the weight of movable partitions, distributed, concentrated, impact, inertia and snow loads, but excluding wind loads."
This section must be used in conjunction with sections 2B and 2C and its principles relate to all forms of low-rise residential buildings.
Adequate provision shall be made to ensure that the building is stable under the likely imposed and wind loading conditions.
This will commonly necessitate meeting the following requirements:
That the overall size and proportioning of the building are limited in accordance with the specific guidance for each form of construction.
That a suitable layout of walls (both internal and external) forming a robust 3 dimensional box structure in plan is constructed with restriction on the maximum size of cells measured in accordance with the specific guidance for each form of construction.
That the internal and external walls are adequately connected either by masonry bonding or by using mechanical connections.
That the intermediate floors and roof are of such construction and interconnection with the walls that they provide local support to the walls and also act as horizontal diaphragms capable of transferring the wind forces to buttressing elements of the building.
"Note: A traditional cut timber roof (i.e. using rafters, purlins and ceiling joists) generally has sufficient built in resistance to instability and wind forces (e.g. from hipped ends, tiling battens, rigid sarking or the like)."
"However, the need for diagonal rafter bracing equivalent to that recommended in BS EN 1995-1-1:2004 with its UK National Annex and additional guidance given in BSI Published Document PD 6693-1:2012 and BS 8103-3:2009 for trussed rafter roofs should be considered, especially for single-hipped and non-hipped roofs of greater than 40° pitch to detached houses."
Section 2B: Sizes of certain timber members in floors and roofs for dwellings.
"Guidance on the sizing of certain members in floors and roofs is given in ‘Span tables for solid timber members in floors, ceilings and roofs (excluding trussed rafter roofs) for dwellings’, published by TRADA, available from Chiltern House, Stocking Lane, Hughenden Valley, High Wycombe, Bucks HP14 4ND."
"Alternative guidance is available in BS EN 1995-1-1:2004 Design of timber structures with its UK National Annex and additional guidance given in BSI Published Document PD 6693-1:2012 and also BS 8103-3:2009 Structural design of low-rise buildings, Code of practice for timber floors and roofs for housing."
"In the geographical areas specified in Table 1, softwood timber for roof construction or fixed in the roof space, including ceiling joists within the void spaces of the roof, should be adequately treated to prevent infestation by the house longhorn beetle (Hylotrupes bajulus L.)."
"Guidance on suitable preservative treatments is given within The Wood Protection Association’s manual ‘Industrial Wood Preservation: Specification and Practice’ (2012), available from 5C Flemming Court, Castleford, West Yorkshire, WF10 5HW."

Structure Approved Document AONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Section 2C:
This section applies to the following building types:
residential buildings of not more than three storeys;
small single-storey non-residential buildings;
small buildings forming annexes to residential buildings (including garages and outbuildings).
"Only the types of wall given in Table 2, which must extend to the full storey height, and parapet walls are considered in this section."
When using this section it should be noted that:
this section must be used in conjunction with section 2A;
"if wall thickness is to be determined according to paragraphs 2C5 to 2C13, all appropriate design conditions given in this section must be satisfied;"
"walls should comply with the relevant requirements of BS EN 1996-2:2006 with its UK National Annex and additional guidance given in BSI Published Document PD 6697:2010, except as regards the conditions given in paragraphs 2C4 and 2C14 to 2C38;"
in formulating the guidance of this section the worst combination of circumstances likely to arise was taken into account.
"If a requirement of this part is considered too onerous in a particular case it may be appropriate to consider a minor departure on the basis of judgement and experience, or to show adequacy by calculation in respect of the aspect of the wall which is subject to the departure rather than for the entire wall;"
the guidance given is based upon the compressive strengths of bricks and blocks being not less than indicated in Tables 6 and 7.
BS EN 1996-1-1:2005 with its UK National Annex gives design strengths for walls where the suitability for use of masonry units of other compressive strengths is being considered.
This section applies only to buildings having proportions within the following parameters (see Diagrams 1 and 2):
residential buildings of not more than three storeys:
"the maximum height of the building measured from the lowest finished ground level adjoining the building to the highest point of any wall or roof should not be greater than 15m, subject to the limits of paragraph 2C16;"
the height of the building H should not exceed twice the least width of the building W1;
the height of the wing H2 should not exceed twice the least width of the wing W2 where the projection P exceeds twice the width W2;
"small single-storey non-residential buildings: height H should not exceed 3m and W (being the greatest length or width of the building) should not exceed 9m (see Diagram 2), subject to the limits of paragraph 2C16;"
"annexes: height H as variously indicated in Diagram 2 should not exceed 3m, subject to the limits of paragraph 2C16."
General wall thickness may be determined according to this section provided:
"conditions relating to the building of which the wall forms part (see paragraphs 2C4, 2C14 to 2C16, 2C38); and"
conditions relating to the wall (see paragraphs 2C17 to 2C37) are met.
"Solid external walls, compartment walls and separating walls in coursed brickwork or blockwork: Solid walls constructed of coursed brickwork or blockwork should be at least as thick as 1/16 of the storey height."
Further requirements are given in Table 3.
"Solid external walls, compartment walls and separating walls in uncoursed stone, flints, etc.:"
"The thickness of walls constructed in uncoursed stone, flints, clunches, bricks or other burnt or vitrified material should not be less than 1.33 times the thickness determined by paragraph 2C6."
Cavity walls in coursed brickwork or blockwork: All cavity walls should have leaves at least 90mm thick and cavities at least 50mm wide.
"The wall ties should have a horizontal spacing of 900mm and a vertical spacing of 450mm, or alternatively should be spaced such that the number of wall ties per square metre is not less than 2.5 ties/m2."
"Wall ties should also be provided, spaced not more than 300mm apart vertically, within a distance of 225mm from the vertical edges of all openings, movement joints and roof verges."
For selection of wall ties for use in a range of cavity widths refer to Table 5.
For specification of cavity wall ties refer to paragraph 2C19.
"For external walls, compartment walls and separating walls in cavity construction, the combined thickness of the two leaves plus 10mm should not be less than the thickness determined by paragraph 2C6 and Table 3 for a solid wall of the same height and length."
"Walls providing vertical support to other walls: Irrespective of the material used in the construction, a wall should not be less in thickness than any part of the wall to which it gives vertical support."
"except for a wall in the lowest storey of a three storey building, carrying load from both upper storeys, which should have a thickness as determined by the equation or 140mm whichever is the greatest."
"Maximum floor area: The guidance of this section assumes that no floor enclosed by structural walls on all sides exceeds 70m2, and that no floor without a structural wall on one side exceeds 36m2."
Parapet walls: The minimum thickness and maximum height of parapet walls should be as given in Diagram 4.
"storey non-residential buildings and of annexes need be only 90mm thick, notwithstanding paragraphs 2C38."
"Modular bricks and blocks: Where walls are constructed of bricks or blocks having modular dimensions, wall thicknesses prescribed in this section which derive from a dimension of brick or block may be reduced by an amount not exceeding the deviation from work size permitted by a British Standard relating to equivalent sized bricks or blocks made of the same material."
"Imposed loads on roofs, floors and ceilings: The design considerations given in this section are intended to be adequate for the imposed loads given in Table 4."
Maximum height of buildings: The design guidance in this section is based on BS EN 1991-1-4:2005 with its UK National Annex.
The maximum heights of buildings given in Table c of Diagram 7 correlate to various site exposure conditions and wind speeds.
A map showing wind speeds is given in Figure 1 of Diagram 6.
"Maximum allowable length and height of the wall: This section does not deal with walls longer than 12m, measured from centre to centre of buttressing walls, piers or chimneys providing restraint, or with walls exceeding 12m in height (see also Table 3)."
Rules of measurement for heights of walls and storeys: The height of a wall or a storey should be measured in accordance with the rules in Diagram 8.
Wall ties: Wall ties should comply with BS EN 845-1 and should be material references 1 or 3 in BS EN 845-1 Table A1 austenitic stainless steel.
Wall ties should be selected in accordance with Table 5 of this Approved Document.
Masonry units: Walls should be properly bonded and solidly put together with mortar and constructed of masonry units conforming to:
clay bricks or blocks to BS EN 771-1;
calcium silicate bricks or blocks to BS EN 771-2;
manufactured stone to BS EN 771-5;
square dressed natural stone to the appropriate requirements described in BS EN 771-6.
"Compressive strength of masonry units: Minimum compressive strength requirements for masonry units according to BS EN Standards are given in Diagram 9, where the masonry units indicated for Conditions A, B and C should have declared compressive strengths of not less than the values given in Table 6."
Normalised compressive strengths for block sized clay and calcium silicate masonry units not complying with brick dimensional format are given in Table 7.
Note: A more detailed approach for obtaining Factor O is given by Figure 3 Diagram 6.
zone for the site from Figure 2 Diagram 6 and
of Factor S from:
"Notes: Table a – Outside of the zones shown in Table a, Factor O = 1.0."
"For elevated sites where orography is significant a more accurate assessment of Factor A can be obtained by using the altitude at the base of the topographic feature instead of the altitude at the site, Table c – see Figure 2 Diagram 6 or, alternatively, Figure 3 Diagram 6."
Sites in town less than 300m from the edge of the town should be assumed to be in country terrain.
"Where a site is closer than 1km to an inland area of water which extends more than 1km in the wind direction, the distance to the coast should be taken as < 2km."
Interpolation may be used in Tables b and c.
"Type 1, 2, 3 or 4 to BSI PD 6697:2010 and selected on the basis of the design loading and design cavity width."
Where face insulated blocks are used the cavity width should be measured from the face of the masonry unit.
The embedment depth of the tie should not be less than 50mm in both leaves.
For cavities wider than 175mm calculate the length as the nominal cavity width plus 125mm and select the nearest stock length.
"For wall ties requiring embedment depths in excess of 50mm, increase the calculated tie length accordingly."
Aggregate concrete masonry units to aerated conc.
This table applies to Group 1 and Group 2 units.
For the EN 771 series of standards for masonry units the values of declared compressive strengths (N/mm²) given in Table 6 are mean values.
Brick: a masonry unit having work sizes not exceeding 337.5mm in length or 112.5mm in height.
Block: a masonry unit exceeding either of the limiting work sizes of a brick and with a minimum height of 190mm.
"For blocks with smaller heights, excluding cuts or make up units, the strength requirements are as for brick except for solid external walls where the blocks should have a compressive strength at least equal to that shown for block for an inner leaf of a cavity wall in the same position."
Group 1 masonry units have not more than 25% formed voids (20% for frogged bricks).
"Group 2 masonry units have formed voids greater than 25%, but not more than 55%."
Values in this table are normalised compressive strengths (N/mm²).
Compressive strengths of masonry units should be derived according to EN 772-1.
The table applies to clay and calcium silicate block masonry units where the work size exceeds 337.5mm in length or 112.5mm in height.
Group 1 masonry units have not more than 25% formed voids (20% for frogged bricks).
"Group 2 masonry units have formed voids greater than 25%, but not more than 55%."

Maximum span of floors: The maximum span for any floor supported by a wall is 6m where the span is measured centre to centre of bearing (see Diagram 10).
Other loading conditions:
Vertical loading on walls should be distributed.
"This may be assumed for concrete floor slabs, precast concrete floors, and timber floors designed in accordance with section 2B, and where the bearing length for lintels is 150mm or greater."
Where a lintel has a clear span of 1200mm or less the bearing length may be reduced to 100mm.
Differences in level of ground or other solid construction between one side of the wall and the other should be less than 4 times the thickness of the wall as shown in Diagram 11.
The combined dead and imposed load should not exceed 70kN/m at base of wall (see Diagram 11).
"Walls should not be subjected to lateral load other than from wind, and that covered by paragraph 2C24(b)."
"The ends of every wall should be bonded or otherwise securely tied throughout their full height to a buttressing wall, pier or chimney."
"Long walls may be provided with intermediate buttressing walls, piers or chimneys dividing the wall into distinct lengths within each storey; each distinct length is a supported wall for the purposes of this section."
"The intermediate buttressing walls, piers or chimneys should provide lateral restraint to the full height of the supported wall, but they may be staggered at each storey."
If the buttressing wall is not itself a supported wall its thickness T2 should not be less than:
half the thickness required by this section for an external or separating wall of similar height and length less 5mm; or
75mm if the wall forms part of a dwelling house and does not exceed 6m in total height and 10m in length; and
90mm in other cases.
"The length of the buttressing wall should be at least 1/6 of the overall height of the supported wall and be bonded or securely tied to the supporting wall and at the other end to a buttressing wall, pier or chimney."
The size of any opening in the buttressing wall should be restricted as shown in Diagram 12.
Design criteria for piers and chimneys providing restraint:
"piers should measure at least 3 times the thickness of the supported wall and chimneys twice the thickness, measured at right angles to the wall."
Piers should have a minimum width of 190mm (see Diagram 13);
"the sectional area on plan of chimneys (excluding openings for fireplaces and flues) should be not less than the area required for a pier in the same wall, and the overall thickness should not be less than twice the required thickness of the supported wall (see Diagram 13)."
"The number, size and position of openings and recesses should not impair the stability of a wall or the lateral restraint afforded by a buttressing wall to a supported wall."
Construction over openings and recesses should be adequately supported.
Dimensional criteria for openings and recesses:
The dimensional criteria are given in Diagram 14 and Table 8.
"No openings should be provided in walls below ground floor except for small holes for services and ventilation, etc. which should be limited to a maximum area of 0.1m² at not less than 2m centres."
"vertical chases should not be deeper than 1/3 of the wall thickness or, in cavity walls, 1/3 of the thickness of the leaf;"
horizontal chases should not be deeper than 1/6 of the thickness of the leaf of the wall;
"chases should not be so positioned as to impair the stability of the wall, particularly where hollow blocks are used."
The amount of any projection should not impair the stability of the wall.
"A wall in each storey of a building should extend to the full height of that storey, and have horizontal lateral supports to restrict movement of the wall at right angles to its plane."
Floors and roofs should:
"act to transfer lateral forces from walls to buttressing walls, piers or chimneys; and"
be secured to the supported wall by connections specified in paragraphs 2C34 and 2C35.
"Walls should be strapped to floors above ground level, at intervals not exceeding 2m and as shown in Diagram 15, by tension straps conforming to BS EN 845-1."
"Take the value of the Factor X from Table 8, or it can be given the value 6, provided the declared compressive strength of the bricks or blocks (in the case of a cavity wall – in the loaded leaf) is not less than 7.3N/mm2."
specifications including material references 1 or 3 (austenitic stainless steel).
The declared tensile strength of tension straps should not be less than 8kN.
Tension straps need not be provided:
"in the longitudinal direction of joists in houses of not more than 2 storeys, if the joists are at not more than 1.2m centres and have at least 90mm bearing on the supported walls or 75mm bearing on a timber wall-plate at each end, and"
"in the longitudinal direction of joists in houses of not more than 2 storeys, if the joists are carried on the supported wall by joist hangers in accordance with BS EN 845-1 of the restraint type described by additional guidance given in BSI Published Document PD 6697:2010 and shown in Diagram 15(c), and are incorporated at not more than 2m centres, and"
"when a concrete floor has at least 90mm bearing on the supported wall (see Diagram 15(d)), and"
"where floors are at or about the same level on each side of a supported wall, and contact between the floors and wall is either continuous or at intervals not exceeding 2m. Where contact is intermittent, the points of contact should be in line or nearly in line on plan (see Diagram 15(e))."
Gable walls should be strapped to roofs as shown in Diagram 16(a) and (b) by tension straps as described in 2C35.
Vertical strapping at least 1m in length should be provided at eaves level at intervals not exceeding 2m as shown in Diagram 16(c) and (d).
Vertical strapping may be omitted if the roof:
"has a pitch of 15° or more, and"
"is tiled or slated, and"
"is of a type known by local experience to be resistant to wind gusts, and"
has main timber members spanning onto the supported wall at not more than 1.2m centres.
"Where an opening in a floor or roof for a stairway or the like adjoins a supported wall and interrupts the continuity of lateral support, the following conditions should be satisfied for the purposes of Section 2C:"
"the maximum permitted length of the opening is to be 3m, measured parallel to the supported wall, and"
"where a connection is provided by means other than by anchor, this should be provided throughout the length of each portion of the wall situated on each side of the opening, and"
"where a connection is provided by mild steel anchors, these should be spaced closer than 2m on each side of the opening to provide the same number of anchors as if there were no opening, and"
there should be no other interruption of lateral support.
The guidance given applies in the following circumstances:
The floor area of the building or annexe does not exceed 36m².
The walls are solidly constructed in brickwork or blockwork using materials which comply with paragraphs 2C19 to 2C22.
Where the floor area of the building or annexe exceeds 10m² the walls have a mass of not less than 130kg/m².
Note: There is no surface mass limitation recommended for floor areas of 10m² or less.
Access to the roof is only for the purposes of maintenance and repair.
The only lateral loads are wind loads.
The maximum length or width of the building or annexe does not exceed 9m.
Published Document PD 6693-1:2012 or BS 8103-3:2009.
The height of the building or annexe does not exceed the lower value derived from Diagram 2.
"The roof is braced at rafter level, horizontally at eaves level and at the base of any gable by roof decking, rigid sarking or diagonal timber bracing, as appropriate, in accordance with BS EN 1995-1-1:2004 with its UK National Annex and additional guidance given in BSI i. Walls are tied to the roof structure vertically and horizontally in accordance with paragraphs 2C32 to 2C36 and with horizontal lateral restraint at roof level in accordance with paragraph (iv) below."
The roof structure of an annexe is secured to the structure of the main building at both rafter and eaves level.
One or two major openings not more than 2.1m in height are permitted in one wall of the building or annexe only.
The width of a single opening or the combined width of two openings should not exceed 5m.
The only other openings permitted in a building or annexe are for windows and a single leaf door.
The size and location of these openings should be in accordance with Diagram 17.
The walls should have a minimum thickness of 90mm.
Walls which do not contain a major opening but exceed 2.5m in length or height should be bonded or tied to piers for their full height at not more than 3m centres as shown in Diagram 18a.
Walls which contain one or two major openings should in addition have piers as shown in Diagrams 18b and 18c.
"Where ties are used to connect piers to walls they should be flat, 20mm x 3mm in cross section, be in stainless steel in accordance with paragraph 2C19, be placed in pairs and be spaced at not more than 300mm centre vertically."
"Walls should be tied horizontally at no more than 2m centres to the roof structure at eaves level, base of gables and along roof slopes as shown in Diagram 19 with straps fixed in accordance with paragraphs 2C35 and 2C36."
Where straps cannot pass through a wall they should be adequately secured to the masonry using suitable fixings.
Isolated columns should also be tied to the roof structure (see Diagram 19).
"Where a chimney is not adequately supported by ties or securely restrained in any way, its height if measured from the highest point of intersection with the roof surface, gutter, etc. should not exceed 4.5W, provided the density of the masonry is greater than 1500kg/m3, where:"
"W is the least horizontal dimension of the chimney measured at the same point of intersection, and"
H is measured to the top of any chimney pot or other flue terminal (see Diagram 20).
There should not be:
non-engineered fill (as described in BRE Digest 427) or wide variation in ground conditions within the loaded area; nor
weaker or more compressible ground at such a depth below the foundation as could impair the stability of the structure.
The following design provisions relate to foundations:
the foundations should be situated centrally under the wall;
for foundations in chemically aggressive soil conditions guidance in BS 8500-1 and BRE Special Digest 1 should be followed.
"In non-aggressive soils, concrete should be composed of Portland cement to BS EN 197-1 and -2 and fine and coarse aggregate conforming to BS EN 12620 and the mix should comply with one of the following recommendations:"
in proportion of 50kg of Portland cement to not more than 200kg (0.1m3) of fine aggregate and 400kg (0.2m3) of coarse aggregate; or
grade ST2 or grade GEN I concrete to BS 8500-2;
"minimum thickness T of concrete foundation should be 150mm or P, whichever is the greater, where P is derived using Table 10 and Diagram 23."
Trench fill foundations may be used as an acceptable alternative to strip foundations;
"foundations stepped on elevation should overlap by twice the height of the step, by the thickness of the foundation, or 300mm, whichever is greater (see Diagram 21)."
"For trench fill foundations the overlap should be twice the height of the step or 1m, whichever is greater;"
steps in foundations should not be of greater height than the thickness of the foundation (see Diagram 21);
"foundations for piers, buttresses and chimneys should project as indicated in Diagram 22 and the projection X should never be less than the value of P where there is no local thickening of the wall."
The recommended minimum widths of foundations given in Table 10 may be used.
II Gravel or sand Medium dense Requires pick for excavation.
Can be excavated with a spade.
Finger pushed in up to 10mm 450 650 Note:
total load exceeds 30kN/m.
The table is applicable only within the strict terms of the criteria described within it.
"Except where strip foundations are founded on rock, the strip foundations should have a minimum depth of 0.45m to their underside to avoid the action of frost."
"This depth, however, will commonly need to be increased in areas subject to long periods of frost or in order to transfer the loading onto satisfactory ground."
"In clay soils subject to volume change on drying (‘shrinkable clays’, with Modified Plasticity Index greater than or equal to 10%), strip foundations should be taken to a depth where anticipated ground movements will not impair the stability of any part of the building taking due consideration of the influence of vegetation and trees on the ground."
"The depth to the underside of foundations on clay soils should not be less than 0.75m on low shrinkage clay soils, 0.9m on medium shrinkage clay soils and 1.0m on high shrinkage clay soils, although these depths may need to be increased in order to transfer the loading onto satisfactory ground, or where there are trees nearby."
"vehicle barrier, then account should be taken of the additional imposed loading, as stipulated in Approved Document K, Protection from falling, collision and impact."
"Where the wall cladding is required to safely withstand lateral pressures from crowds, an appropriate design loading is given in BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 with its UK National Annex and the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (4th Edition, 1997)."
The selection of fixings for supporting cladding should be determined from a consideration of the proven performance of the fixing and the risks associated with the particular application.
In this regard applications should be designated as being either non-redundant (where the failure of a single fixing could lead to the detachment of the cladding) or redundant (where failure or excessive movement of one fixing results in load sharing by adjacent fixings) and the required reliability of the fixing determined accordingly.
"Guideline for European Technical Approval Metal Anchors for use in Concrete Parts 1-5, which cover both redundant and non-redundant applications, and Part 6 which covers ‘Anchors for multiple use in non-structural applications’ and which can effectively be regarded as covering redundant use."
The UK definition of ‘multiple use’ is contained in an annexe to ETAG Part 6 and is framed in such a way that all applications can be validated as to whether or not they conform to this category without calculation.
All ETAG parts may be downloaded in English from www.eota.be.
"The strength of fixings should be derived from tests using materials representative of the material into which the fixing is to be anchored, taking account of any inherent weaknesses that may affect the strength of the fixing, e.g. cracks in concrete due to shrinkage and flexure, or voids in masonry construction."
The design loads will generally be available from the manufacturer’s test data determined from an ETA or an extant British Standard.
Note: ETAs are available which cover use either in both cracked and non-cracked concrete or in non-cracked concrete only.
Those which cover both cracked and non-cracked concrete allow higher loads for use in non-cracked than in cracked concrete.
Wall cladding presents a hazard if it becomes detached from the building.
This section provides guidance on the support and fixing of wall cladding.
An acceptable level of safety can be achieved by different means depending on the type and location of the cladding.
"The guidance given relates to all forms of cladding, including curtain walling and glass facades."
"It is not intended to provide guidance concerning the weather resistance of wall cladding which is included in Approved Document C, Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture, or guidance on resistance to spread of fire which is included in Approved Document B, Fire safety, or guidance in relation to sound insulation, which is included in Approved Document E, Resistance to the passage of sound."
"The cladding will meet the safety a. the cladding is capable of safely sustaining and transmitting to the supporting structure of the building all dead, imposed and wind loads, and"
the cladding is securely fixed to and supported by the structure of the building.
"This shall comprise both vertical support and horizontal restraint, and"
"provision is made, where necessary, to accommodate differential movement of the cladding and the supporting structure of the building, and"
the cladding and its fixings (including any support components) are of durable materials; the design life of the fixings being not less than that of the cladding.
Fixings shall be corrosion resistant and of a material type appropriate for the local environment.
Wind loading on the cladding should be derived from BS EN 1991-1-4:2005 with its UK National Annex with due consideration given to local increases in wind suction arising from funnelling of the wind through gaps between buildings.
"Where the cladding is required to support other fixtures, e.g. handrails, and fittings, e.g. antennae and signboards, account should be taken of the loads and forces arising from such fixtures and fittings."

"All materials used to cover roofs, excluding windows of glass in residential buildings with roof pitches of not less than 15°, shall be capable of safely withstanding the concentrated imposed loads upon roofs specified in BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 with its UK National Annex."
Transparent or translucent covering materials for roofs not accessible except for normal maintenance and repair are excluded from the requirement to carry the concentrated imposed load upon roofs if they are non-fragile or are otherwise suitably protected against collapse.
The re-covering of roofs is commonly undertaken to extend the useful life of buildings.
Roof structures may be required to carry underdrawing or insulation provided at a time later than their initial construction.
This section provides guidance on determining whether such work to a roof constitutes a material alteration under the Building Regulations.
Where the work involves a significant change in the applied loading the structural integrity of the roof structure and the supporting structure should be checked to ensure that upon completion of the work the building is not less compliant with Requirement A1 than the original building.
A significant change in roof loading is 4.4 when the loading upon the roof is increased by more than 15%.
Consideration might also be given to whether the roof covering being replaced is the original as-built covering.
"Where such checking of the existing roof structure indicates that the construction is unable to sustain any proposed increase in loading (e.g. due to overstressed members or unacceptable deflection leading to ponding), appropriate strengthening work or replacement of roofing members should be undertaken."
This is classified as a material alteration.
In carrying out the checks mentioned in 4.6 paragraph 4.3 an increase of stress in a structural member arising from increased loading does not necessarily indicate that the roof structure is less compliant than the original roof provided an adequate factor of safety is maintained.
"Where work will significantly decrease the roof dead loading, the roof structure and its anchorage to the supporting structure should be checked to ensure that an adequate factor of safety is maintained against uplift of the roof under imposed wind loading."
This Approved Document deals with the following Requirements which are contained in the Building Regulations 2010.
In the Secretary of State’s view the Requirement of A3 will be met by an appropriate choice of measures to reduce the sensitivity of a building to disproportionate collapse should an accident occur.
The guidance in Section 5 deals with the means of meeting this performance criterion.
"The requirement will be met by adopting the following approach for ensuring that the building is sufficiently robust to sustain a limited extent of damage or failure, depending on the consequence class of the building, without collapse."
Determine the building’s consequence class from Table 11.
"For Consequence Class 1 buildings – Provided the building has been designed and constructed in accordance with the rules given in this Approved Document, or other guidance referenced under Section 1, for meeting compliance with Requirement A1 and A2 in normal use, no additional measures are likely to be necessary."
"For Consequence Class 2a buildings – In addition to the Consequence Class 1 measures, provide effective horizontal ties, or effective anchorage of suspended floors to walls, as described in the Standards listed under paragraph 5.2 for framed and load-bearing wall construction (the latter being defined in paragraph 5.3 below)."
"For Consequence Class 2b buildings – In addition to the Consequence Class 1 measures, provide effective horizontal ties, as described in the Standards listed under paragraph 5.2 for framed and load-bearing wall construction (the latter being defined in paragraph 5.3 below), together with effective vertical ties, as defined in the Standards listed under paragraph 5.2, in all supporting columns and walls."
"Alternatively, check that upon the notional removal of each supporting column and each beam supporting one or more columns, or any nominal length of load-bearing wall (one at a time in each storey of the building), the building remains stable and that the area of floor at any storey at risk of collapse does not exceed 15% of the floor area of that storey or 100m2, whichever is smaller, and does not extend further than the immediate adjacent storeys (see Diagram 24)."
Critical situations for design should be selected that reflect the conditions that can reasonably be foreseen as possible during the life of the building.
The structural form and concept and any protective measures should then be chosen and the detailed design of the structure and its elements undertaken in accordance with the recommendations given in the Standards given in paragraph 5.2.
Eurocode – Basis of structural design; with UK National Annex to BS EN 1990:2002+A1:2005.
"Details of the effective horizontal and vertical ties including tie force determination, together with the design approaches for checking the integrity of the building following the notional removal of vertical members and the design of key elements, are given in the following Standards:"
"Where the notional removal of such columns and lengths of walls would result in an extent of damage in excess of the above limit, then such elements should be designed as a ‘key element’ as defined in paragraph 5.3 below."
"For Consequence Class 3 buildings – A systematic risk assessment of the building should be undertaken taking into account all the normal hazards that may reasonably be foreseen, together with any abnormal hazards."
The nominal length of load-bearing wall construction referred to in 5.1d should be taken as follows:
"in the case of a reinforced concrete wall, the distance between lateral supports subject to a maximum length not exceeding 2.25H,"
"in the case of an external masonry wall, or timber or steel stud wall, the length measured between vertical lateral supports,"
"in the case of an internal masonry wall, or timber or steel stud wall, a length not exceeding 2.25H,"
where H is the storey height in metres.
Note: Annex A of BS EN 1991-1-7:2006 with its UK National Annex provides corresponding guidance.
"A ‘key element’, as referred to in paragraph 5.1d, should be capable of sustaining an accidental design loading of 34kN/m2 applied in the horizontal and vertical directions (in one direction at a time) to the member and any attached components (e.g. cladding etc.) having regard to the ultimate strength of such components and their connections."
Such accidental design loading should be assumed to act simultaneously with all other design loadings (i.e. wind and imposed loading) in accidental actions loading combination.
For buildings intended for more than one type of use the Consequence Class should be that pertaining to the most onerous type.
"In determining the number of storeys in a building, basement storeys may be excluded provided such basement storeys fulfil the robustness requirements of Consequence Class 2b buildings."
BS EN 1991-1-7:2006 with its UK National Annex also provides guidance that is comparable to Table 11.
BS EN 1990:2002+A1:2005 with its UK National Annex provides guidance on accidental design loading and accidental actions loading combination for ‘key elements’ and expressions 6.11a and 6.11b of that Standard are relevant.
Note: Annex A of BS EN 1991-1-7:2006 with its UK National Annex provides corresponding guidance for ‘key elements’.
For the purposes of this Guidance the term ‘load-bearing wall construction’ includes masonry cross-wall construction and walls comprising close centred timber or lightweight steel section studs.

Separate guidance applies to means of escape within the flat and within the common parts of the building that lead to a place of safety.
Flats at ground level are treated similarly to dwellinghouses.
"With increasing height, more complex provisions are needed."
The provisions in this section make the following assumptions.
Any fire is likely to be in a flat.
There is no reliance on external rescue.
Simultaneous evacuation of all flats is unlikely to be necessary due to compartmentation.
Fires in common parts of the building should not spread beyond the fabric in the immediate vicinity.
"In some cases, however, communal facilities exist that require additional measures to be taken."
Provisions are recommended to support a stay put evacuation strategy for blocks of flats.
It is based on the principle that a fire is contained in the flat of origin and common escape routes are maintained relatively free from smoke and heat.
"It allows occupants, some of whom may require assistance to escape in the event of a fire, in other flats that are not affected to remain."
Sufficient protection to common means of escape is necessary to allow occupants to escape should they choose to do so or are instructed/aided to by the fire service.
A higher standard of protection is therefore needed to ensure common escape routes remain available for a longer period than is provided in other buildings.
Paragraphs 3.6 to 3.23 deal with the means of escape within each flat.
Paragraphs 3.25 to 3.89 deal with the means of escape in common areas of the building (including mixed use buildings in paragraphs 3.76 and 3.77).

other part of the building or
other occupancies NOTE:
Bathrooms do not need to have fire doorsets provided that the bathroom is separated by fire resisting construction from the adjacent rooms.
"Where access from any habitable room to the entrance hall or flat entrance is impossible without passing through another room, all of the following conditions should be met (Diagram 3.4)."
Bedrooms should be separated from living accommodation by fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30) and fire doorsets (minimum E 20).
The alternative exit should be in the part of the flat that contains the bedrooms.
because escape is possible in two directions.

The following paragraphs deal with means of escape from the entrance doors of flats to a final exit.
They do not apply to flats with a top storey that is a maximum of 4.5m above ground level (designed in accordance with paragraphs 3.15 to 3.17).
Reference should also be made to the following.
Requirement B3 regarding compartment walls and protected shafts.
Requirement B5 regarding access for the fire and rescue service.
"A person escaping through the common area, if confronted by the effects of a fire in another flat, should be able to turn away from it and make a safe escape via an alternative route."
"From the flat entrance door, a single escape route is acceptable in either of the following cases."
The flat is on a storey served by a single common stair and both of the following apply.
Every flat is separated from the common stair by a protected lobby or common protected corridor (see Diagram 3.7).

The door between stair and lobby should be free from security fastenings.
"If the flats have protected entrance halls,"
"If the flats have protected entrance halls, the lobby between the common stair and flat entrance is not essential."
The arrangements shown also apply to the top storey.
"If the travel distance across the lobby in diagram (a) exceeds 4.5m, Diagram 3.7 applies."
"Where, in Diagram (b), the lobby between the common stair and the flat is omitted in small single stair buildings, an automatic opening vent with a geometric free area of at least 1m² is required at the top of the stair, which is operated on detection of smoke at any storey in the stair."
"For further guidance on the fire rating of the fire doorsets from the corridor to the flat and/or stairway refer to Appendix C, Table C1."
Paragraph 3.27 may be modified using the guidance in clause 7.3 of BS 9991.
"Where a storey or part of a building has multiple escape routes available, one may be over a flat roof that complies with all of the following."
It should be part of the same building from which escape is being made.
The route across the roof should lead to a storey exit or external escape route.
"The part of the roof (including its supporting structure) forming the escape route, and any opening within 3m of the escape route, should be of fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30)."
The route should be clearly defined and guarded by walls and/or protective barriers to protect against falling.
Common escape routes 3.31 The following paragraphs deal with means of escape from the entrance doors of flats to a final exit.
Escape route travel distances should comply with Table 3.1.
An escape route should not pass through one stair enclosure to reach another.
It may pass through a protected lobby (minimum REI 30) of one stair to reach another.
Common corridors should be protected corridors.
"The wall between each flat and the corridor should be a compartment wall (minimum REI 30 where the top storey is up to 5m above ground level, otherwise REI 60)."
Divide a common corridor connecting two or more storey exits with a fire doorset fitted with a self-closing device (minimum E 30 Sa).

"Every doorway or other exit providing access to a means of escape, other than exits in ordinary use (e.g. main entrances), should be distinctively and conspicuously marked by an exit sign in accordance with BS ISO 3864-1 and BS 5499-4."
"For this reason, blocks of flats with a single stair in regular use would not usually require any fire exit signage."
"Advice on fire safety signs, including emergency escape signs, is given in the HSE publication Safety Signs and Signals: Guidance on Regulations."
Some buildings may require additional signs to comply with other legislation.
"To limit potential damage to cables in protected circuits, all of the following should apply."
Cables should be sufficiently robust.
Cable routes should be carefully selected and/or physically protected in areas where cables may be exposed to damage.
Methods of cable support should be class A1 rated and offer at least the same integrity as the cable.
They should maintain circuit integrity and hold cables in place when exposed to fire.
A protected circuit to operate equipment during a fire should achieve all of the following.

It should be separate from any circuit provided for another purpose.
"Guidance on cables for large and complex buildings is given in BS 5839-1, BS 5266-1 and BS 8519."
"Despite the provisions described, it is probable that some smoke will get into the common corridor or lobby from a fire in a flat."
There should therefore be some means of ventilating the common corridors/lobbies to control smoke and so protect the common stairs.
"This means of ventilation offers additional protection to that provided by the fire doors to the stair, as well as some protection to the corridors/lobbies."
Ventilation can be natural (paragraphs 3.50 to 3.53) or mechanical (paragraph 3.54).
"Except in buildings that comply with Diagram 3.9, the corridor or lobby next to each stair should have a smoke vent."
The location of the vent should comply with both of the following.
Be as high as practicable.
Be positioned so the top edge is at least as high as the top of the door to the stair.
Smoke vents should comply with one of the following.
They should be located on an external wall with minimum free area of 1.5m2.
"They should discharge into a vertical smoke shaft, closed at the base, that meets all of the following criteria."
The shaft should conform to the following conditions.
Have a minimum cross-sectional area of 1.5m2 (minimum dimension 0.85m in any direction).
"Open at roof level, minimum 0.5m above any surrounding structures within 2m of it horizontally."

"If smoke is detected in the common corridor or lobby, both of the following should occur."
"Simultaneous opening of vents on the storey where the fire is located, at the top of the smoke shaft and to the stair."
"Vents from the corridors or lobbies on all other storeys should remain closed, even if smoke is subsequently detected on storeys other than where the fire is located."
A vent to the outside with a minimum free area of 1m2 should be provided from the top storey of the stair.
"In single stair buildings, smoke vents on the storey where the fire is initiated, and the vent at the head of the stair, should be activated by smoke detectors in the common parts."
"In buildings with more than one stair, smoke vents may be activated manually."
"The control system should open the vent at the head of the stair before, or at the same time as, the vent on the storey where the fire is located."
Smoke detection is not required for ventilation purposes in this instance.
"Refuse storage chambers, refuse chutes and refuse hoppers should be sited and constructed in accordance with BS 5906."

Near the windows of flats.
A building should provide access to more than one common stair if it does not meet the criteria for a single common stair (see paragraph 3.26 and 3.27).
A stair of acceptable width for everyday use will be sufficient for escape purposes.
"If it is also a firefighting stair, it should be at least 1100mm wide."
The width is the clear width between the walls or balustrades.
Any handrails and strings intruding into that width by a maximum of 100mm on each side may be ignored.
Section 7 provides guidance on avoiding the spread of fire between storeys.
"For a stair that is also a firefighting stair, guidance in Section 15 should be followed."
Every common stair should be a protected stairway.
"Where the protected stairway passes from one compartment to another, it should be within a protected shaft."
"With some configurations of external wall, a fire in one part of a building could subject the external wall of a protected stairway to heat (for example, where the two are adjacent at an internal angle in the façade, as shown in Diagram 3.10)."
"If a protected stairway projects beyond, is recessed from or is in an internal angle of the adjoining external wall of the building, then the minimum distance between an unprotected area of the building enclosure and an unprotected area of the stair enclosure should be 1800mm."
Flats may be served by an external stair if the provisions in paragraphs 3.66 to 3.69 are followed.
"Where a storey (or part of a building) is served by a single access stair, that stair may be external provided both of the following conditions are met."
The stair serves a floor not more than 6m above the ground level.
The stair meets the provisions in paragraph 3.68.

The stair meets the provisions in paragraph 3.68.
No fire resistance required for door
See paras 3.66 and 3.67 for
See paras 3.66 and 3.67 for the maximum height of stair.
Any external escape stair should meet all of the following conditions (Diagram 3.11).
"Doors to the stair should be fire resisting (minimum E 30) and be fitted with a self-closing device, except for a single exit door from the building to the top landing of a downward-leading external stair, provided it is the only door onto the landing."

Fire resisting construction (minimum RE 30) should be provided for any part of the building (including doors) within 1800mm of the escape route from the foot of the stair to a place of safety.
This does not apply if there are alternative escape routes from the foot of the external escape stair.
Glazing in areas of fire resisting construction should be fixed shut and fire resisting (in terms of integrity but not insulation) (minimum E 30).
Stairs more than 6m in height above ground level (e.g. where they are provided above a podium) should be protected from adverse weather.
Protection should prevent the build-up of snow or ice but does not require full enclosure.
"Access to an external escape stair may be via a flat roof, provided the flat roof meets the requirements of paragraph 3.30."
The construction separating two adjacent protected stairways (or exit passageways leading to different final exits) should be imperforate.
"If a building does not meet the criteria of paragraph 3.28, an escape stair forming part of the only escape route from an upper storey should not continue down to serve a basement storey."
The basement storey should be served by a separate escape stair.
"Where multiple escape stairs serve the upper storeys, only one needs to end at ground level."
Other stairs may connect with the basement storeys if there is a protected lobby or a protected corridor between the stairs and accommodation at each basement level.
"Except in buildings described in paragraph 3.28, common stairs forming part of the only escape route from a flat should not serve any of the following."
Covered car park.
Fuel storage space.
Other ancillary accommodation of similar fire risk.
"Where a common stair is not part of the only escape route from a flat, it may also serve ancillary accommodation from which it is separated by a protected lobby or protected corridor (minimum REI 30)."
"Where a stair serves an enclosed car park or place of special fire hazard, the lobby or corridor should have a minimum 0.4m2 of permanent ventilation or be protected from the ingress of smoke by a mechanical smoke control system."
For refuse chutes and storage see paragraphs 3.55 to 3.58.
"In buildings with a maximum of three storeys above the ground storey, stairs may serve both flats and other occupancies, provided that the stairs are separated from each occupancy by protected lobbies (minimum REI 30) at each storey."

The stair is separated from occupancies on lower storeys by a protected lobby (minimum REI 30) at each of those storeys.
"The stair enclosure has at least the same standard of fire resistance as the structural elements of the building (see Appendix B, Table B4); if the stair is a firefighting stair, it should comply with the provisions in Section 15 (see also paragraph 3.60)."
Any automatic fire detection and alarm system fitted in the main part of the building also covers all flats.
Any security measures in any parts of the building do not prevent escape at all material times.
"A protected stairway should not be used for anything else, except a lift well or electricity meters."
"In single stair buildings, electricity meters should be in securely locked cupboards."
Cupboards should be separated from the escape route by fire resisting construction.
"Gas service and installation pipes and meters should not be within a protected stairway, unless installed in accordance with the Pipelines Safety Regulations 1996 and the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998."
"Every protected stairway should lead to a final exit, either directly or via a protected exit passageway."
Any protected exit corridor or stair should have the same standard of fire resistance and lobby protection as the stair it serves.
"The flights and landings of escape stairs should be constructed of materials achieving class A2-s3, d2 or better in all of the following situations."
If the escape stair is the only stair in a building with more than three storeys.
If the escape stair is within a basement storey.
If the escape stair serves any storey that has a floor level more than 18m above ground or access level.

Helical stairs and spiral stairs may form part of an escape route provided they are designed in accordance with BS 5395-2.
"If they are intended to serve members of the public, stairs should be type E (public) stairs."
Fire resistance test criteria are set out in Appendix C. Standards of performance are summarised in Table C1.
"If glazed elements in fire resisting enclosures and doors can only meet the required integrity performance, their use is limited."
"These limitations depend on whether the enclosure forms part of a protected shaft (see Section 7) and the provisions set out in Appendix B, Table B5."
"If both integrity and insulation performance can be met, there is no restriction in this document on the use or amount of glass."
"Glazed elements should also comply with the following, where necessary."

"In mixed use buildings, non-domestic kitchens, car parks and plant rooms should have separate and independent extraction systems."
Extracted air should not be recirculated.
"Under fire conditions, ventilation and air-conditioning systems should be compatible with smoke control systems and need to be considered in their respective design."
"If air handling ducts pass through fire-separating elements, the fire performance of the elements should be maintained using one or more of the following four methods."
"In most ductwork systems, a combination of the four methods is best."
Method 1 – thermally activated fire dampers.
Method 2 – fire resisting enclosures.

"Guidance on the design, installation and maintenance of measures to contain fires or slow their spread is given in Ensuring Best Practice for Passive Fire Protection in Buildings produced by the Association for Specialist Fire Protection (ASFP)."
"Further information on generic systems, their suitability for different applications and guidance on test methods, is given in the ASFP Red Book."
These sections deal with the following requirement from Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
Section 10 also refers to regulation 7(2) of the Building Regulations 2010.
Guidance on regulation 7(1) can be found in Approved Document 7.
"The external walls of the building shall adequately resist the spread of fire over the walls and from one building to another having regard to the height, use and position of the building."
"The roof of the building shall adequately resist the spread of fire over the roof and from one building to another, having regard to the use and position of the building."
"are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used,"
"are adequately mixed or prepared, and"
"are applied, used or fixed so as adequately to perform the functions for which they are designed; and"
in a workmanlike manner.
"Building work shall be carried out so that relevant metal composite material does not become part of an external wall, or specified attachment, of any building."
"Subject to paragraph (3), building work shall be carried out so that materials which become part of an external wall, or specified attachment, of a relevant building are of European Classification A2-s1, d0 or A1 (classified in accordance with the reaction to fire classification)."
cavity trays when used between two leaves of masonry;
any part of a roof (other than any part of a roof which falls within paragraph (iv) of regulation 2(6)) if that part is connected to an external wall;
door frames and doors;
fibre optic cables;
insulation and water proofing materials used below ground level or up to 300mm above that level;
intumescent and fire stopping materials where the inclusion of the materials is necessary to meet the requirements of Part B of Schedule 1;

contains one or more dwellings;
contains an institution; or
contains a room for residential purposes; and
“above ground level” in relation to a storey means above ground level when measured from the lowest ground level adjoining the outside of a building to the top of the floor surface of the storey.
The external envelope of a building should not contribute to undue fire spread from one part of a building to another part.
This intention can be met by constructing external walls so that both of the following are satisfied.
The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building and spread of fire over the outside surface is restricted.
"The materials used to construct external walls, and attachments to them, and how they are assembled do not contribute to the rate of fire spread up the outside of the building."
The extent to which this is necessary depends on the height and use of the building.
The external envelope of a building should not provide a medium for undue fire spread to adjacent buildings or be readily ignited by fires in adjacent buildings.
This intention can be met by constructing external walls so that all of the following are satisfied.
The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building is restricted.
The amount of thermal radiation that falls on a neighbouring building from window openings and other unprotected areas in the building on fire is not enough to start a fire in the other building.
Flame spread over the roof and/or fire penetration from external sources through the roof is restricted.
The extent to which this is necessary depends on the use of the building and its position in relation to adjacent buildings and therefore the site boundary.
The external wall of a building should not provide a medium for fire spread if that is likely to be a risk to health and safety.
"Combustible materials and cavities in external walls and attachments to them can present such a risk, particularly in tall buildings."
The guidance in this section is designed to reduce the risk of fire spread as well as the risk of ignition from flames coming from adjacent buildings.
"This section provides guidance on resisting fire spread over external walls; however, it does not deal with fire resistance of external walls."
"An external wall may need fire resistance to meet the provisions of Section 3 (Means of escape – flats), Section 6 (Loadbearing elements of structure – flats), Section 11 (Resisting fire spread from one building to another) or Section 15 (Access to buildings for firefighting personnel – flats)."
The external walls of buildings other than those described in regulation 7(4) of the Building Regulations should achieve either of the following.
"Follow the provisions given in paragraphs 10.5 to 10.9, which provide guidance on all of the following."
Materials and products.
Cavities and cavity barriers.
Meet the performance criteria given in BRE report BR 135 for external walls using full-scale test data from BS 8414-1 or BS 8414-2.
"In relation to buildings of any height or use, consideration should be given to the choice of materials (including their extent and arrangement) used for the external wall, or attachments to the wall (e.g. balconies, etc.), to reduce the risk of fire spread over the wall."
The external surfaces (i.e. outermost external material) of external walls should comply with the provisions in Table 10.1.
The provisions in Table 10.1 apply to each wall individually in relation to its proximity to the relevant boundary.
In all cases all the following provisions apply.
"• Regulation 7(1A) prohibits the use of relevant metal composite materials in the external walls, and specified attachments, of all buildings of any height (see paragraphs 10.11 and 10.12)."
• The advice in paragraph 10.4 should always be followed.
"In addition to the provisions within this table, buildings with a storey 18m or more above ground level should also meet the provisions of paragraph 10.6."
"In addition to the provisions within this table, buildings with a storey 11m or more above ground level should also meet the provisions of paragraph 10.7."
The restrictions for these buildings apply to all the materials used in the external wall and specified attachments (see paragraphs 10.13 to 10.16 for further guidance).
Profiled or flat steel sheet at least 0.5mm thick with an organic coating of no more than 0.2mm thickness is also acceptable.
Timber cladding at least 9mm thick is also acceptable.
10m is measured from the top surface of the roof.
"In a building with a storey 18m or more in height (see Diagram D6 in Appendix D) any insulation product, filler material (such as the core materials of metal composite panels, sandwich panels and window spandrel panels but not including gaskets, sealants and similar) etc. used in the construction of an external wall should be class A2-s3, d2 or better (see Appendix B)."
This restriction does not apply to masonry cavity wall construction which complies with Diagram 8.2 in Section 8.
"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph."
"In buildings that include a ‘residential’ purpose (purpose groups 1 and 2) with a storey 11m or more in height (see Diagram D6 in Appendix D) any insulation product, filler material (such as the core materials of metal composite panels, sandwich panels and window spandrel panels but not including gaskets, sealants and similar) etc. used in the construction of an external wall should be class A2-s1, d0 or better (see Appendix B)."
This restriction does not apply to masonry cavity wall construction which complies with Diagram 8.2 in Section 8.
"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph."
"Best practice guidance for green walls (also called living walls) can be found in Fire Performance of Green Roofs and Walls, published by the Department for Communities and Local Government."
"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph."
Cavity barriers should be provided in accordance with Section 5 in dwellinghouses and Section 8 in flats.
Balconies 10.10 In buildings that include a ‘residential’ purpose (purpose groups 1 and 2) with a storey 11m or more in height (see Diagram D6 in Appendix D) balconies should meet either of the following conditions.
"Only contain materials achieving class A1 or A2-s1, d0, except for any of the following."
Cavity trays when used between two leaves of masonry.

Fibre optic cables.
Achieve both of the following conditions.
"Have an imperforate soffit which extends to the full area of the balcony, achieves a minimum REI 30 rating and is constructed of materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or better."
"Materials achieving class B-s1, d0 or worse extending beyond the boundary of a single compartment should include a band of material rated class A2-s1, d0 or better, a minimum of 300mm in width centred on that boundary line."
"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph."
"Metal composite materials 10.11 Regulation 7(1A) prohibits the use of relevant metal composite materials in the external walls, and specified attachments, of all buildings of any height."
"Relevant metal composite materials are defined (in regulation 2(6)(c)) as any panel or sheet, having a thickness of no more than 10mm which is composed of a number of layers two or more of which are made of metal, alloy or metal compound and one or more of which is a substantial layer made of a material having a gross calorific value of more than 35MJ/kg when tested in accordance with BS EN ISO 1716."
A substantial layer is defined as a layer which is at least 1mm thick or has a mass per unit area of at least 1kg/m².
Materials 10.13 Regulation 7(1)(a) requires that materials used in building work are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used.
Regulation 7(2) sets requirements in respect of external walls and specified attachments in relevant buildings.
Further guidance on regulation 7(1) can be found in HM Government’s Manual to the Building Regulations.
Regulation 7(2) applies to any building with a storey at least 18m above ground level (as measured in accordance with Diagram D6 in Appendix D) and which contains one or more dwellings; an institution; or a room for residential purposes.
"It requires that all materials which become part of an external wall or specified attachment achieve class A2-s1, d0 or class A1 in accordance with BS EN 13501-1, other than those exempted by regulation 7(3)."
"The above includes student accommodation, care homes, sheltered housing, hospitals, dormitories in boarding schools, hotels, hostels and boarding houses."
See regulation 7(4) for the definition of relevant buildings.
Transposition to a national class (Table B1) does not apply to the classification in this paragraph.
"External walls and specified attachments are defined in regulation 2(6) and these definitions include any parts of the external wall as well as balconies, solar panels and solar shading."
Regulation 7(3) provides an exemption for certain components found in external walls and specified attachments.
"Regulations 5(k) and 6(3) provide that, where the use of a building is changed such that the building becomes a building described in regulation 7(4), the construction of the external walls, and specified attachments, must be investigated and, where necessary, work must be carried out to ensure they only contain materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or class A1, other than those exempted by regulation 7(3)."
"Solar shading devices 10.18 Regulation 7(2) requires that the curtain and or slats of solar shading devices in a relevant building (as defined in regulation 7(4)) achieve class A1 or A2-s1, d0."
The curtain of solar shading devices cannot be classified as a membrane in accordance with regulation 7(3).
Solar shading devices installed up to 4.5m above ground level are not required to meet the requirements of regulation 7(2).
The provisions of regulation 7 apply in addition to requirement B4.
"Therefore, for buildings described in regulation 7(4), the potential impact of any products incorporated into or onto the external walls and specified attachments should be carefully considered with regard to their number, size, orientation and position."
Particular attention is drawn to the following points.
"Membranes used as part of the external wall construction above ground level should achieve a minimum of class B-s3, d0."
"Roofing membranes do not need to achieve a minimum of class A2-s1, d0 when used as part of a roof connecting to an external wall."
Internal linings should comply with the guidance provided in Section 4. c. Any part of a roof should achieve the minimum performance as detailed in Section 12.
"As per regulation 7(3), window frames and glass (including laminated glass) are exempted from regulation 7(2)."
Window spandrel panels and infill panels must comply with regulation 7(2).
Thermal breaks are small elements used as part of the external wall construction to restrict thermal bridging.
There is no minimum performance for these materials.
"However, they should not span two compartments and should be limited in size to the minimum required to restrict the thermal bridging (the principal insulation layer is not to be regarded as a thermal break)."
Regulation 7(2) only applies to specified attachments.
"Shop front signs and similar attachments are not covered by the requirements of regulation 7(2), although attention is drawn to paragraph 10.21g."
"While regulation 7(2) applies to materials which become part of an external wall or specified attachment, consideration should be given to other attachments to the wall which could impact on the risk of fire spread over the wall."
Any material achieving class A1fl or A2fl-s1 in accordance with BS EN 13501-1 is exempted when it meets both of the following conditions.
It forms the top horizontal floor layer of a balcony.
It is provided with an imperforate substrate under it which extends to the full size of the class A1fl or A2fl-s1 material.
The following assumptions enable a reasonable standard of resistance to the spread of fire to be specified.
The size of a fire depends on the compartmentation within the building.
"A fire may involve a complete compartment, but will not spread to other compartments."
"The intensity of a fire is related to the building use, but can be moderated by a sprinkler system."
"Fires in ‘residential’ and ‘assembly and recreation’ buildings (purpose groups 1, 2 and 5) represent a greater risk to life."
A building on the far side of the relevant boundary meets both of the following conditions.
Has a similar elevation to the one in question.
Is the same distance as the one in question from the common boundary.
The radiated heat passing through any part of the fire resisting external wall may be discounted.
"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over the provisions within this section."
"If a reduced separation distance between buildings, or increased amount of unprotected area, is required, smaller compartments should be considered."
The fire resistance of a wall depends on its distance from the relevant boundary (see Diagram 11.1).
Separation distances are measured to boundaries to ensure that the location and design of buildings on adjoining sites have no influence on the building under consideration.
The boundary that a wall faces is the relevant boundary (Diagram 11.2).
It may be one of the following.
The site boundary.
"The centre line of a space where further development is unlikely, such as a road, railway, canal or river."
An assumed notional boundary between two buildings on the same site (Diagram 11.3) where either of the following conditions is met.
"One or both of the buildings are in the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose group 1, 2 or 5)."
The buildings will be operated/managed by different organisations.
Coincide with the side of the building (A).
Be parallel to the side of the building (B1 or B2).
Be at an angle of maximum of the building (C).
Compliance with the provisions for
Compliance with the provisions for
The notional boundary should be set in the area between the two buildings using the following rules:
The notional boundary is assumed to exist in the space between the buildings and is positioned so that one of the buildings would comply with the provisions for space separation having regard to the amount of its unprotected area.
"In practice, if one of the buildings is existing, the position of the boundary will be set by the space separation factors for that building."
"The siting of the new building, or the second building if both are new, can then be checked to see that it also complies, using the notional boundary as the relevant boundary for the second building."
"Parts of an external wall with less fire resistance than the appropriate amount given in Appendix B, Table B4, are called unprotected areas."
"Where a fire resisting external wall has an external surface material that is worse than class B-s3, d2 and is more than 1mm thick, that part of the wall should be classified as an unprotected area equating to half its area (Diagram 11.4)."
"Unprotected areas should meet the conditions in Diagram 11.5, and the rest of the wall should be fire resisting from both sides."
"External surface materials facing the boundary should be class B-s3, d2 or better."
"Unprotected areas should not exceed the result given by one of the methods in paragraph 11.16, and the rest of the wall (if any) should be fire resisting but only from the inside of the building."
Exclude external walls of stairways in a protected shaft when assessing unprotected areas (see Diagram 11.5).
"In an otherwise protected wall, small unprotected areas may be ignored where they meet the conditions in Diagram 11.5."
"Where both of the following apply, separation distances may be determined from the wall rather than from the edge of the canopy (Diagram 11.6)."
The canopy is attached to the side of a building.
The edges of the canopy are a minimum of 2m from the relevant boundary.
Canopies that fall within class 6 or class 7 of Schedule 2 to the regulations (Exempt Buildings and Work) are exempt from the Building Regulations.
Space separation may be disregarded if a canopy is all of the following.
Above a limited risk or controlled hazard.
A minimum of 1000mm from the relevant boundary.
"Projections from the building line, such as a canopy or a loading platform, can be ignored when assessing separation distance."
This does not apply where the canopy is enclosed by side walls.
Roofs with a pitch of more than 70 degrees to the horizontal should be assessed in accordance with this section.
"Vertical parts of a pitched roof, such as dormer windows, should be included only if the slope of the roof exceeds 70 degrees."
It is a matter of judgement whether a continuous run of dormer windows that occupies most of a steeply pitched roof should be treated as a wall rather than a roof.
Portal frames are often used in single storey industrial and commercial buildings where there may be no need for fire resistance of the structure (requirement B3).
"However, where a portal framed building is near a relevant boundary, the external wall near the boundary may need fire resistance to restrict the spread of fire between buildings."
"It is generally accepted that a portal frame acts as a single structural element because of the moment-resisting connections used, especially at the column/rafter joints."
"Thus, in cases where the external wall of the building cannot be wholly unprotected, the rafter members of the frame, as well as the column members, may need to be fire protected."
The design method for this is set out in SCI Publication P313.
The recommendations in the SCI publication for designing the foundation to resist overturning do not need to be followed if the building is fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.
"Normally, portal frames of reinforced concrete can support external walls requiring a similar degree of fire resistance without specific provision at the base to resist overturning."
"Existing buildings may have been designed to comply with all of the following guidance, which is also acceptable."
The column members are fixed rigidly to a base of sufficient size and depth to resist overturning.
"There is brick, block or concrete protection to the columns up to a protected ring beam providing lateral support."
There is some form of roof venting to give early heat release.
Two simple methods are given for calculating the acceptable amount of unprotected area in an external wall that is a minimum of 1000mm from any point on the relevant boundary.
More precise methods are described in BRE report BR 187 and may be used instead.
When using BR 187 the following radiation intensity at each unprotected area should be assumed.
"84kW/m2 if the purpose group of the building is ‘residential’ (purpose groups 1 or 2), ‘office’ (purpose group 3) or ‘assembly and recreation’ (purpose group 5) or if the building is an open-sided multi-storey car park (purpose group 7(b))."
"168kW/m2 if the purpose group of the building is ‘shop and commercial’ (purpose group 4), ‘industrial’ (purpose group 6) or ‘storage and other non-residential’ (purpose group 7(a))."
This method applies to small buildings intended to be used for blocks of flats or dwellinghouses.
The building should not exceed three storeys in height (excluding basements) or 24m in length.
Each side of the building should meet the limits stated in Diagram 11.7.
Any small unprotected areas falling within the limits shown in Diagram 11.5 can be ignored.
This method may be used for buildings or compartments for which method 1 is not appropriate.
The building should not exceed 10m in height.
Each side of the building should meet the limits stated in Table 11.1.
Any areas falling within the limits shown in Diagram 11.5 can be ignored.
Intermediate values may be obtained by interpolation.
"The total percentage of unprotected area is found by dividing the total unprotected area by the area of a rectangle that encloses all the unprotected areas, and multiplying the result by 100."
"If a building is fitted throughout with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E, either of the following is permitted."
"The boundary distance can be halved, to a minimum distance of 1m."
The amount of unprotected area can be doubled.
Provisions for the fire properties of roofs are given in other parts of this document.
"‘Roof covering’ describes one or more layers of material, but not the roof structure as a whole."
Requirement B1 – for roofs that are part of a means of escape.
Requirement B2 – for the internal surfaces of rooflights as part of internal linings.
Requirement B3 – for roofs that are used as a floor and for roofs passing over a compartment wall.
Section 11 – the circumstances in which a roof is subject to the provisions for space separation.
"Separation distance is the minimum distance from the roof, or part of the roof, to the relevant boundary (paragraph 11.4)."
Table 12.1 sets out separation distances by the type of roof covering and the size and use of the building.
"EC of 6 September 2000, implementing Council Directive 89/106/EEC, can be considered to fulfil all of the requirements for the performance characteristic ‘external fire performance’ without the need for testing, provided that any national provisions on the design and execution of works are fulfilled, and can be used without restriction."
The performance of rooflights is specified in a similar way to the performance of roof coverings.
Plastic rooflights may also be used.
"Table 12.2 and Diagram 12.1 set the limitations for using plastic rooflights whose lower surface has a minimum class D-s3, d2 rating."
Table 12.3 sets the limitations for using thermoplastic materials with a TP(a) rigid or TP(b) (see also Diagram 12.1) classification.
The method of classifying thermoplastic materials is given in Appendix B.
"Other than for the purposes of Diagram 5.2, polycarbonate or uPVC rooflights achieving a minimum rating of class C-s3, d2 can be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification."
"When used in rooflights, unwired glass a minimum of 4mm thick can be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification."
"If the performance of thatch or wood shingles cannot be established, they should be regarded as having an EROOF(t4) classification in Table 12.1."
"Consideration can be given to thatched roofs being closer to the relevant boundary than shown in Table 12.1 if, for example, all of the following precautions (based on the LABC publication Thatched Buildings (the Dorset Model): New Properties and Extensions) are incorporated in the design."
The rafters are overdrawn with construction having not less than 30 minutes’ fire resistance.
The guidance given in Approved Document J is followed.
The smoke alarm installation (see Section 1) extends to the roof spaces.
guidance to requirement B2 in Section 4.
"Surrounding roof covering to be a material of class A2-s3, d3 or better for at least 3m distance."
"Where Diagram 5.2a or 5.2b applies, rooflights should be at least 1500mm from the compartment wall."
l Not acceptable.
Separation distances do not apply to the boundary between roofs of a pair of semi-detached dwellinghouses and to enclosed/covered walkways.
"However, see Diagram 5.2 if the roof passes over the top of a compartment wall."
"Polycarbonate and uPVC rooflights that achieve a class C-s3, d2 rating by test may be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) designation."

Heat and smoke from basement fires vented via stairs can inhibit access for firefighting personnel.
"This may be reduced by providing smoke outlets, or smoke vents, which allow heat and smoke to escape from the basement levels to the open air."
They can also be used by the fire and rescue service to let cooler air into the basements (Diagram 16.1).
Each basement space should have one or more smoke outlets.
"Where this is not practicable (for example, the plan area is deep and the amount of external wall is restricted by adjoining buildings), the perimeter basement spaces may be vented, with other spaces vented indirectly by opening connecting doors."
This does not apply for places of special fire hazard (see paragraph 16.7).
"If a basement is compartmented, each compartment should have one or more smoke outlets, rather than indirect venting."
A basement storey or compartment containing rooms with doors or windows does not need smoke outlets.
"Smoke outlets connecting directly to the open air should be provided from every basement storey, except for any basement storey that has both of the following."

"If the smoke outlet terminates in a readily accessible position, it may be covered by a panel, stallboard or pavement light that can be broken out or opened."
The position of covered smoke outlets should be suitably indicated.
Outlets should not be placed where they prevent the use of escape routes from the building.
"If basement storeys are fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E, a mechanical smoke extraction system may be provided as an alternative to natural venting."
Sprinklers do not need to be installed on the other storeys unless needed for other reasons.
Car parks are not normally expected to be fitted with sprinklers (see Section 11 of Approved Document B Volume 2).

This section deals with the following regulation of the Building Regulations 2010.
consists of or includes the erection or extension of a relevant building; or
"is carried out in connection with a relevant change of use of a building,"
and Part B of Schedule 1 imposes a requirement in relation to the work.
"The person carrying out the work shall give fire safety information to the responsible person not later than the date of completion of the work, or the date of occupation of the building or extension, whichever is the earlier."
"In this regulation— (a) “fire safety information” means information relating to the design and construction of the building or extension, and the services, fittings and equipment provided in or in connection with the building or extension which will assist the responsible person to operate and maintain the building or extension with reasonable safety;"
"a “relevant building” is a building to which the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 applies, or will apply after the completion of building work;"
"a “relevant change of use” is a material change of use where, after the change of use takes place, the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 will apply, or continue to apply, to the building; and"
“responsible person” has the meaning given by article 3 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.
The aim of this regulation is to ensure that the person responsible for the building has sufficient information relating to fire safety to enable them to manage the building effectively.
The aim of regulation 38 will be achieved when the person responsible for the building has all the information to enable them to do all of the following.
Understand and implement the fire safety strategy of the building.
Maintain any fire safety system provided in the building.
Carry out an effective fire risk assessment of the building.
"For building work involving the erection or extension of a relevant building (i.e. a building to which the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 applies, or will apply), or the relevant change of use of a building, fire safety information should be given to the responsible person at one of the following times."
When the project is complete.
When the building or extension is first occupied.
This section is a guide to the information that should be provided.
"Guidance is in terms of essential information and additional information for complex buildings; however, the level of detail required should be considered on a case-by-case basis."
Basic information on the location of fire protection measures may be sufficient.
An as-built plan of the building should be provided showing all of the following.
Escape routes – this should include exit capacity (i.e. the maximum allowable number of people for each storey and for the building).
Location of fire-separating elements (including cavity barriers in walk-in spaces).

"Specifications of fire safety equipment provided, including routine maintenance schedules."
Any assumptions regarding the management of the building in the design of the fire safety arrangements.
"Any provision enabling the evacuation of disabled people, which can be used when designing personal emergency evacuation plans."
All buildings should have arrangements for detecting fire and raising the alarm.
"In most buildings, fires are detected by people, either by sight or smell, and therefore often nothing more is needed."
"The siting of the new building, or the second building if both are new, can then be checked to see that it also complies, using the"
"In assessing appropriate solutions, warnings need to be heard and understood throughout the premises."
"Other than for some small buildings/premises, an electrically operated fire alarm system should be provided."
"In some situations, the alarm should be operated by a fire detection system."
The detailed specification should be compatible with the fire strategy for the building.
The term ‘fire alarm system’ describes the combination of components for giving an audible and/or other perceptible warning of fire.
"In this document, the term ‘fire detection system’ describes any type of automatic sensor network and associated control and indicating equipment."
"Sensors may be sensitive to smoke, heat, gaseous combustion products or radiation."
Automatic sprinkler systems can also be used to operate a fire alarm system.
"In ‘residential (institutional)’ and ‘residential (other)’ occupancies (purpose groups 2(a) and 2(b)), automatic fire detection and alarms should be provided."
Automatic fire detection and alarm systems should be provided in non-residential occupancies where a fire could break out in an unoccupied part of the premises (e.g. a storage area or a part of the building that is not visited on a regular basis) and prejudice the means of escape from occupied part(s) of the premises.
"Automatic fire detection will also be necessary where fire protection systems, such as pressure differential systems or door releases, need to operate automatically."
Every building design should be assessed individually.
"General guidance on the category of fire detection system that may need to be provided within a building can be found in Table A1 of BS 5839-1. 1.8 Where an electrically operated fire detection and alarm system is provided, it should comply with BS 5839-1."
BS 5839-1 specifies three categories of system.
Category L – for the protection of life.
Category M – manual fire detection and alarm systems.
Category P – for property protection.
Category L systems are divided into the following.
L1 - systems installed throughout the protected building.
L2 - systems installed only in defined parts of the protected building (a category L2 system will normally include the coverage required of a category L3 system).
"systems designed to warn of fire at an early enough stage to enable all occupants, other than possibly those in the room where the fire started, to escape safely before the escape routes become impassable because of fire, smoke or toxic gases."
"systems installed within those parts of the escape routes that comprise circulation areas and circulation spaces, such as corridors and stairs."
"systems in which the protected area(s) and/or the location of detectors are designed to satisfy a specific fire safety objective (other than that of a category L1, L2, L3 or L4 system)."
Type P systems are divided into the following.
systems installed throughout the protected building.
systems installed only in defined parts of the protected building.
Electrical alarm system call points should comply with either of the following.
Call points should be installed in accordance with BS 5839-1. Type B (indirect operation) call points of BS EN 54-11 should only be used with the approval of the building control body.
"A voice alarm system complying with BS 5839-8, and giving a fire warning different from other signals in general use, may be considered if either of the following applies."
People might not respond quickly to a fire warning.
People are unfamiliar with the fire warning arrangements.
"In premises where lots of members of the public are present, an initial general alarm may be undesirable."
Any fire alarm system that first alerts staff should comply with BS 5839-1.
"Where the escape strategy is based on simultaneous evacuation, actuation of the fire alarm system should give warning from all fire alarm sounders."
"Where phased evacuation is planned, a staged alarm system is appropriate."
BS 9999 provides guidance for fire detection and alarm systems in buildings containing atria.
Clause 18 of BS 5839-1 gives detailed guidance on the design and selection of fire alarm warnings for people with impaired hearing.
"In buildings or part of a building where people may be in relative isolation, a visual and audible fire alarm may be the most appropriate solution."
"In buildings where the population is managed, a vibrating personal paging system may be more appropriate."
"Fire detection and alarm systems must be properly designed, installed and maintained."
"A design, installation and commissioning certificate should be provided for fire detection and alarm systems."
"Third party certification schemes for fire protection products and related services are an effective means of providing assurances of quality, reliability and safety."
Fire detection and alarm systems sometimes trigger other systems.
The interface between systems must be reliable.
Particular care should be taken if the interface is facilitated via another system.
"Where any part of BS 7273 applies to the triggering of other systems, the recommendations of that part of BS 7273 should be followed."
"Student accommodation 1.18 In student residences that are designed and occupied as a block of flats, separate automatic detection should be provided in each self-contained flat where all of the following apply."
A group of up to six students shares the flat.
Each flat has its own entrance door.
The compartmentation principles for flats in Section 7 of Approved Document B Volume 1 have been followed.
"Where a total evacuation strategy is adopted, the alarm system should follow the guidance elsewhere in this section."
"Means of escape should be provided from any point on a storey to the storey exit, for all types of building."
The general principle is that any person confronted by a fire within a building can turn away from it and escape safely.
"For small shop, office, industrial, storage and other similar premises, the guidance on small premises (see section 4) may be followed instead of the provisions in this section, if they meet both of the following conditions."
No storey has an area more than 280m2.
There is a maximum of two storeys plus a basement storey.
The number of escape routes and exits that should be provided depends on both of the following.
"The number of occupants in the room, tier or storey."
The limits on travel distance to the nearest exit given in Table 2.1 (which apply only to the nearest exit; other exits may be further away).
"In multi-storey buildings, if more than one stair is needed for vertical escape, every part of each storey should have access to more than one stair."
An area may be in a dead end provided the alternative stair is accessible.
"In mixed use buildings, separate means of escape should be provided from any storeys or parts of storeys used for the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose groups 1, 2 and 5)."
A single escape route is acceptable for either of the following.
"Parts of a floor from which a storey exit can be reached within the limit for travel distance in one direction shown in Table 2.1 (see also paragraph 2.8), provided the following apply."
"For places of assembly and bars, no one room in this situation has more than 60 people."
"For ‘residential (institutional)’ buildings (purpose group 2(a)), no one room in this situation has more than 30 people."
Occupant number calculations are described in Appendix D.
"A storey with no more than 60 people, where the limits on travel distance in one direction only are satisfied (see Table 2.1)."
"In many cases, the beginning of a route will not have an alternative escape route (for example, a single exit from a room into a corridor where escape is possible in two directions)."
This is acceptable if both of the following apply.
The travel distance to the nearest storey exit is within the limits for routes where escape is possible in more than one direction (Table 2.1).
The travel distance for the ‘one direction only’ section of the route does not exceed the limit for travel distance where there is no alternative escape route (Table 2.1).
Diagram 2.1 shows how to measure travel distances from a dead end in an open storey layout.
Travel distance in a dead-end condition should meet all of the following.
Angle ABD should be at least 45 degrees.
Distance CBA or CBD (whichever is less) should be no more than the maximum travel distance given for alternative escape routes.
Distance CB should be no more than the maximum travel distance where there are no alternative escape routes.
Assembly and recreation:
Place of special fire hazard(4) Plant room or roof-top plant:
Maximum travel distance(1) where travel is possible in:
"If the internal layout of partitions, fittings, etc. is not known, direct distances, rather than travel distances, should be assessed."
The direct distance should be assumed to be two-thirds of the actual travel distance.
Maximum part of travel distance within the room.
"This limit applies within the bedroom and any associated dressing room, bathroom or sitting room, etc."
The distance is measured to the door to the protected corridor that serves the room or suite.
Sub-item (b) applies from that point along the bedroom corridor to a storey exit.
"In industrial and storage buildings, the appropriate travel distance depends on the level of fire hazard associated with the processes and materials being used."
"Higher hazard includes manufacturing, processing or storage of significant amounts of hazardous goods or materials, including any of the following."
" Any compressed, liquefied or dissolved gas."
 Any substance that becomes dangerous by interaction with either air or water.
" Any liquid substance with a flash point below 65°C, including whisky or other alcoholic liquor."
 Any corrosive substance.
 Any oxidising agent.
 Any substance liable to spontaneous combustion.
" Any substance that changes or decomposes readily, giving out heat when doing so."
 Any solid substance with a flash point less than 120°C.
 Any substance that is likely to spread fire by flowing from one part of a building to another.
Places of special fire hazard are listed in the definitions in Appendix A.
Maximum part of travel distance within the room/area.
Travel distance outside the room/area should comply with the limits for the purpose group of the building or part.
Measures to restrict access to the building (or parts of it) should not adversely affect fire safety provisions.
"It may be reasonable to close some escape routes outside normal business hours, but measures should remain to safely evacuate people left inside the building (see paragraph 5.6)."
The building design should be based on the number of occupants.
"If the number is not known, use the appropriate floor space factors (Appendix D)."
Table 2.2 gives the minimum number of escape routes and exits from a room or storey for different numbers of occupants.
This number is likely to be increased by the need to observe travel distances and other practical considerations.
The width of escape routes and exits is given in paragraph 2.18.
Alternative escape routes should satisfy one of the following criteria.
They are in directions 45 degrees or more apart (Diagram 2.2).
"They are in directions less than 45 degrees apart, but separated from each other by fire resisting construction."
Alternative escape routes are available from C because angle ACB is 45 degrees or more and therefore distance CA or CB (whichever is the less) should be no more than the maximum travel distance given for alternative escape routes.
ADB is less than 45 degrees (therefore see Diagram 2.1).
There is also no alternative escape route from E.
An inner room is at risk if a fire starts in the access room (Diagram 2.3).
Such an arrangement should only be accepted if all of the following conditions are satisfied.
The occupant number of the inner room does not exceed:
60 people for other purpose groups.
The inner room is not a bedroom.
The inner room is entered directly from the access room (but not via a corridor).
The escape route from the inner room does not pass through more than one access room.
The travel distance from any point in the inner room to the exits from the access room does not exceed the distances in Table 2.1.
The access room meets both of the following conditions.
It is not a place of special fire hazard.
It is in the control of the same occupier.
One of the following arrangements is made.
The enclosures (walls or partitions) of the inner room stop a minimum of 500mm below the ceiling.
"The door or walls of the inner room contain a vision panel (minimum 0.1m2), so people can see if a fire starts in the access room."
The access room is fitted with an automatic fire detection and alarm system to warn occupants of the inner room if a fire starts in the access room.
Arrangement A Needs no special provision.
Arrangement B Should observe the inner room provisions in paragraph 2.11.
"Where a central core has more than one exit, storey exits should be remote from one another and no two exits should be approached from the same lift hall, common lobby or undivided corridor (Diagram 2.4)."
"Escape routes should not be within 4.5m of openings between floors, such as for an escalator, unless either of the following applies."
The direction of travel is away from the opening.
An alternative escape route does not pass within 4.5m of the open connection (Diagram 2.5).
The doors at both ends of the area marked ‘S’ should be self-closing fire doorsets unless the area is sub-divided such that any fire in that area will not be able to prejudice both sections of corridor at the same time.
"If that area is a lift lobby, doors should be provided as shown in Figure 9 in BS 9999."
"Services, toilets, etc."
From A and B at least one direction of travel is away from the opening.
"From C, where the initial direction of travel is towards the opening, one of the escape routes is not less than 4.5m from the opening."
"Where a storey has more than one escape stair, it should be planned so that it is not necessary to pass through one stair to reach another."
"However, it would be acceptable to pass through one stair’s protected lobby to reach another stair."
"Where they serve protected stairways that are part of primary circulation routes, self-closing fire doors should be fitted with an automatic release mechanism, to avoid them being rendered ineffective by misuse."
"Otherwise, the stair (and any associated exit passageway) should not form part of the primary circulation route between different parts of the building at the same level."
"If a storey contains areas for consuming food and/or drink, and where that is not the main use of the building, then both of the following apply."
"A minimum of two escape routes should be provided from each area, except from inner rooms that meet the conditions in paragraph 2.11."
Those escape routes should lead directly to a storey exit without entering a kitchen or similar area of high fire hazard.
"Where a storey is divided into areas of occupancy under separate ownership or tenancy, then both of the following apply."
The means of escape from each occupancy should not pass through any other occupancy.
"If a common corridor or circulation space is on the escape route, one of the following should apply."
It should be a protected corridor.
A suitable automatic fire detection and alarm system should be installed throughout the storey.
"The width of escape routes and exits should meet the provisions in Table 2.3, as well as the guidance in Approved Document M."
"If the maximum number of people likely to use the escape route and exit is not known, it should be calculated using the occupant number guidance in Appendix D."
Guidance on the spacing of fixed seating for auditoria is given in Annex D of BS 9999.
See Appendix D for methods of measurement.
Widths may need to be increased to meet guidance in Approved Document M.
Widths less than 1050mm should not be interpolated.
"May be reduced to 530mm for gangways between fixed storage racking, other than in public areas of ‘shop and commercial’ (purpose group 4) buildings."
5mm/person does not apply to an opening serving fewer than 220 people.
"Where multiple storey exits are available, fire might prevent one from being used."
"Remaining exits need to be wide enough for all occupants, so when using Table 2.3, the largest exit should be discounted."
Stairs should be at least as wide as any storey exit leading onto them.
"While some stairs are not subject to discounting (paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15), because the stairs will be available for other floors, the storey exits onto them are."
"To calculate how many people two or more available exits (after discounting) can accommodate, add together the maximum numbers of people that each exit width can accommodate."
"For example, three exits each 850mm wide accommodate 33110 = 330 people."
"If a ground floor storey exit and a stair share a final exit (via a ground floor lobby), then the final exit should be wide enough to evacuate people at a maximum flow rate equal to or greater than from the storey exit and stair combined (Diagram 2.6)."
This can be calculated using the following formula:
S is the stair width in metres.
"If the number of people (N) entering the lobby from the ground storey is more than 60, then the distance from the foot of the stair or the storey exit to the final exit should be a minimum of 2m (see Diagram 2.6)."
"If that minimum distance cannot be achieved, the width of the final exit (W) should be at least the width of the stair plus the width of the storey exit."
A ground floor storey exit serving 250 people shares a common final exit with a 1.2m wide stair.
A corridor serving as part of the means of escape in any of the following circumstances should be a protected corridor.
Every corridor that serves bedrooms.
"Every dead-end corridor (excluding recesses and extensions a maximum of 2m deep, as shown in Diagrams 2.7 and 2.8)."
Any corridor shared by two or more occupancies (paragraph 2.17).
"If a corridor is used for a means of escape but is not a protected corridor, even though the enclosing partitions may have no fire resistance, both of the following should be met to inhibit the spread of smoke."
"Partitions should continue to the soffit of the structural floor above, or to a suspended ceiling."
"Openings into rooms from the corridor should be fitted with doors, which do not need to be fire doorsets."
"Open planning will not inhibit the spread of smoke, but occupants can become aware of a fire quickly."
A corridor providing access to alternative escape routes should be divided by fire doorsets fitted with a self-closing device (and associated screens) where both of the following apply.
It is more than 12m long.
It connects two or more storey exits.
The fire doorsets (including any screens) should be approximately mid-way between the two storey exits.
"They should safeguard the route from smoke, while considering the layout of the corridor and any adjacent fire risks."
"For buildings other than dwellings (purpose groups 2 to 7): if a cavity exists above the enclosures to a corridor as described above (because the enclosures are not carried to full storey height or the underside of the roof covering at the top storey), the potential for smoke to bypass the enclosure should be restricted by one of the following methods."
Method 1 – Fitting cavity barriers on the line of the enclosure(s) to and across the corridor (Diagram 2.9).
Method 2 – Dividing the storey using fire resisting construction that passes through the line of the division of the corridor (Diagram 2.9).
Any cavity above this division should be fitted with cavity barriers on the line of division of the storey and the corridor.
"Method 3 – Enclosing the cavity on the lower side by a fire resisting ceiling that extends throughout the building, compartment or separated part."
Any door that could provide a path for smoke to bypass the division should be fitted with a self-closing device (but need not necessarily be fire resisting).
Cavity barriers on line of corridor
A cavity barrier may be used in any ceiling cavity over the sub-division.
"Where dead ends of corridors exceeding 4.5m long provide access to a point from which alternative escape routes are available, they should be separated by self-closing fire doorsets (together with any associated screens) from any part of the corridor that either:"
Continues past one storey exit to another (Diagram 2.10b).
"Alternatively, the stairs and corridors may be protected by a pressurisation system complying with BS EN 12101-6."
Additional measures to safeguard means of escape from smoke are given in Section 10.
"Where an external escape route is beside an external wall of the building, the external wall should be of fire resisting construction in both of the following zones."
Within 1800mm of the escape route.
Up to 1100mm above the surface of the escape route.
This does not apply to external escape stairs (see paragraph 3.32).
"Where a storey or part of a building has multiple escape routes available, one may be over a flat roof if it does not serve a ‘residential (institutional)’ (purpose group 2(a)) building, or part of a building intended for use by members of the public."
"Where an escape route over a flat roof is provided, the roof should comply with all of the following."
It should be part of the same building from which escape is being made.
The route across the roof should lead to a storey exit or external escape route.
"The part of the roof forming the escape route and its supporting structure, together with any opening within 3m of the escape route, should be fire resisting (minimum REI 30)."
The route should be clearly defined and guarded by walls and/or protective barriers to protect from falling.
"The choice of fire safety strategy depends on the way a building is designed, furnished, staffed and managed, and on the level of dependency of the residents."
"In care homes for the elderly, some or all residents are likely to need help to evacuate."
Buildings should generally be designed for progressive horizontal evacuation (PHE) in accordance with paragraphs 2.35 to 2.46.
"For other care home types, the most appropriate of either a PHE or simultaneous evacuation strategy should be identified."
"The approach adopted in the design of a building must be recorded and communicated to the building management team, who can adopt procedures compatible with the building design."
The guidance below on PHE is for care homes where the provisions of the Firecode documents do not apply (see paragraph 0.10).
PHE requires areas used for the care of residents to be divided into protected areas by compartment walls and compartment floors.
"Protected areas provide a place of relative safety, from which further evacuation can be made if necessary."
Each storey used for the care of residents should be divided by compartment walls into at least three protected areas.
All floors should be compartment floors.
Every protected area should have a minimum of two exits to adjoining protected areas.
Maximum travel distances within a protected area should be both of the following.
To the exit to the adjoining protected area: as shown in Table 2.1.
From any point to a storey exit or a final exit: 64m.
A fire in one protected area should not prevent occupants of other areas from reaching a final exit (Diagram 2.11).
Escape routes should not pass through ancillary accommodation listed in paragraph 2.44.
The number of residents’ beds in protected areas should be based on an assessment of both of the following.
The number of staff likely to be available.
The level of assistance that residents may require.
"The maximum number of residents’ beds in one protected area should not exceed 10, but may need to be lower depending on the assessment."
A protected area used for horizontal evacuation from an adjoining protected area should have a floor area able to accommodate its own occupants plus those from the largest adjoining protected area.
Bedrooms and all ancillary accommodation should be enclosed in fire resisting construction.
A fire detection and alarm system should be provided to L1 standard in accordance with BS 5839-1.
Each bedroom in a care home should be enclosed in fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30) with fire resisting doors (minimum E 30).
Every corridor serving bedrooms should be a protected corridor (see paragraph 2.24).
Bedrooms should not contain more than one single or double bed.
Ancillary accommodation such as all of the following should be enclosed by fire resisting construction (minimum REI 30).
Staff changing and locker rooms.
"If doors fitted with a self-closing device could present an obstacle to residents, the following hardware in accordance with BS EN 1155 is appropriate."
Bedrooms: free-swing door closers.
Circulation spaces: hold-open devices.
"When a sprinkler system is provided in accordance with Appendix E, the following variations to the guidance given in paragraphs 2.35 to 2.45 are acceptable."
Fire doorsets to bedrooms do not need to be fitted with self-closing devices.
Protected areas may contain more than 10 beds.
Bedrooms may contain more than one bed.
"If any of the variations are made, the management procedures should take account of the larger number of residents that may need assistance, and the need to manually close bedroom doors during sleeping hours."
The limits on horizontal travel escape distances mean most people should be able to independently reach a protected escape route or final exit.
The following guidance also includes measures for people who are unable to use stairs without help.
"In larger buildings, some escape stairs may need to serve as firefighting stairs, and Section 17 will also apply."
"If a building contains storeys, or parts of storeys, in different purpose groups, it is necessary to consider providing either of the following."
Separate escape routes from the areas of different use.
Other effective means to protect common escape routes.
A single escape stair may serve a building (or part of a building) in the following situations.
When independent escape routes from areas in different purpose groups are not necessary (see paragraph 3.2).
From a basement that is allowed to have a single escape route in accordance with paragraph 2.6b and Table 2.1.
"In small premises, provided it meets the conditions in paragraph 4.2."
From a building that meets both of the following conditions.
It has no storey with a floor level more than 11m above ground level.
It is allowed to have only a single escape route in every storey in accordance with paragraph 2.6b and Table 2.1.
An office building with a maximum of five storeys above the ground storey where both of the following apply.
The travel distance from every point in each storey does not exceed the distances given in Table 2.1 for escape in one direction only.
Every storey with a floor level more than 11m above ground level has an alternative means of escape.
A factory comprising no more than either of the following.
"For low risk buildings, two storeys above the ground storey."
"For normal risk buildings, one storey above the ground storey, provided the travel distance from every point on each storey does not exceed the distances given in Table 2.1 for escape in one direction only."
Process plant buildings with a maximum of 10 people.
Refuges form part of the management plan and offer relatively safe areas for people to wait for a short period only.
Refuges should meet the following conditions.
Refuges should be provided on every storey (except ones consisting only of plant rooms) of each protected stairway providing an exit from that storey.
"Refuges do not need to be located within the stair enclosure, but should enable direct access to the stair."
The number of refuge spaces does not need to equal the number of wheelchair users who may be in the building.
A single refuge may be occupied by more than one person during the evacuation procedure.
The following are both examples of satisfactory refuges.
"An enclosure such as a compartment (Diagram 3.1), protected lobby, protected corridor or protected stairway (Diagram 3.2)."
"An area in the open air, such as a flat roof, balcony, podium or similar place, that meets both of the following."
It is protected (or remote) from any fire risk.
It has its own means of escape.
Refuges should be a minimum of 900mm  1400mm in size and accessible by someone in a wheelchair.
"Where sited in a protected stairway, protected lobby or protected corridor, they should not reduce the width of the escape route or obstruct the flow of people escaping."
Refuges should be provided with an emergency voice communication (EVC) system complying with BS 5839-9.
It should consist of Type B outstations communicating with a master station in the building control room (if one exists) or next to the fire detection and alarm panel.
"In some buildings, wireless technology may be more appropriate."
Refuges and evacuation lifts should be clearly identified.
In protected lobbies and protected stairways there should be a blue mandatory sign worded ‘Refuge – keep clear’ in addition to fire safety signs.
"Paragraph 5.32 gives guidance on using lifts, including evacuation lifts, during a fire."
People occupying Compartment A would not reach an available refuge until they had entered Compartment
Two fire doorsets in the partition are necessary in case access to one of the doorsets is blocked by fire.
Provision where access to the refuge is counter to the access ﬂow within the stairway.
The width of escape stairs should meet all of the following conditions.
It should be at least as wide as any exits giving access to the stairs.
It should be no less than the minimum widths given in Table 3.1.
It should not reduce at any point on the way to a final exit.
"It should not exceed 1400mm in stairs taller than 30m, unless a central handrail is provided."
"When a central handrail is provided, the stair width on each side of it should be considered separately when assessing stair capacity."
Approved Document K requires stairs more than 2000mm wide in public buildings to have a central handrail.
"If an exit route from a stair is also the escape route from the ground storey and/or basement storey, the width of the exit route may need to be increased (see paragraph 2.23)."
Assessed as likely to use the stair in a fire emergency.
Section 6 of BS 9999 recommends that firefighting stairs should be at least 1100mm wide.
"See Table 3.2 for the size of stairs for simultaneous evacuation, and Table 3.3 for phased evacuation."
"To comply with the guidance in Approved Document M on minimum widths for areas accessible to disabled people, this may need to be increased to 1000mm."
The width depends on the number of stairs provided and the escape strategy (simultaneous or phased evacuation).
"If the maximum number of people needing to use escape stairs is unknown, calculate it using the floor space factors in Appendix D."
"Regardless of escape strategy, where two or more stairs are provided, it should be assumed that one might not be available during a fire."
Each stair should be discounted in turn to ensure the capacity of the remaining stairs is adequate.
This applies to buildings with or without a sprinkler system.
Paragraph 3.14 does not apply if either of the following applies.
Escape stairs are protected by a smoke control system designed in accordance with BS EN 12101-6.
Escape stairs are approached on each storey (except the top storey) through a protected lobby.
"Despite these exceptions, at least one storey exit still needs to be discounted (paragraph 2.21)."
Paragraph 3.34 identifies cases where stairs need lobby protection.
The width of escape stairs should take account of the number of people using them while evacuating all storeys at the same time.
The following stairs should be designed to allow simultaneous evacuation.
All stairs serving basements.
All stairs serving buildings with open spatial planning.
All stairs serving ‘residential (other)’ (purpose group 2(b)) or ‘assembly and recreation’ (purpose group 5) buildings.
Annexes B and C of BS 9999 include designs based on simultaneous evacuation.
The capacity of stairs of widths from 1000mm to 1800mm is given in Table 3.2.
Maximum number of people served by a stair of width:
The capacity of stairs that serve more than 10 storeys may be obtained by using linear extrapolation.
The capacity of stairs not less than 1100mm wide may also be obtained by using the formulas in paragraph 3.18.
"Unless a central handrail is provided, stairs with a rise of more than 30m should be a maximum width of 1400mm (see paragraph 3.10)."
Stairs wider than 2000mm should have a central handrail (see paragraph 3.11).
"As an alternative to Table 3.2, the capacity of stairs 1100mm wide or wider can be found using either of the following formulas:"
N is the number of storeys served.
Separate calculations should be made for stairs serving basement storeys and stairs serving upper storeys.
"The population, P, should be divided by the number of available stairs."
The formula is useful to determine the width of stairs where people are not distributed evenly – either within a storey or between storeys.
"In the formula, 200W represents the number of people estimated to have left the stair after 2.5 minutes of evacuation, and 50 (W – 0.3)(N – 1) represents the number of people estimated to be on the stair after 2.5 minutes of evacuation."
A 14 storey building contains 12 storeys of offices (ground + 11).
The top two storeys contain flats that are served by separate stairs.
"What is the minimum width needed for the stairs that serve the office floors, for simultaneous evacuation?"
"In the 11 above-ground-floor offices, 1200 people use the stairs."
"In this example, two stairs are shown to satisfy the travel distance limitations."
"The top office storey is at a height greater than 18m, therefore both stairs need lobby protection (see paragraph 3.34)."
"Because both stairs are entered at each level via a protected lobby, both stairs can be assumed to be available (see paragraph 3.15)."
From the formula:
Therefore both stairs should be at least 1070mm wide.
"But this needs to be increased to 1100mm, because the formula applies to stairs 1100mm wide or wider (see paragraph 3.18)."
This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21.
It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 110 people in Table 2.3).
"(e.g. 1000 people occupy floors 1 to 9, and 200 occupy floors 10 and 11)."
"The top office storey is at a height greater than 18m, therefore both stairs need lobby protection (see paragraph 3.34)."
"Because both stairs are entered at each level via a protected lobby, both stairs can be assumed to be available (see paragraph 3.15)."
To find the width of:
 the stairs serving floors 10 and 11:
From the formula:
Therefore both stairs between the 9th floor landing and the top floor should be at least 460mm wide.
"But this needs to be increased to 1100mm, because the formula applies to stairs 1100mm wide or wider (see paragraph 3.18)."
This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21.
It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 100 people in Table 2.3).
 the stairs serving floors 1 to 9:
From the formula:
Therefore both stairs between the ninth floor landing and the ground floor should be at least 1200mm wide.
This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21.
It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum widths needed for 134 people in Table 2.3).
"Phased evacuation cannot be used in every type of building, but can be advantageous for escape stairs in high buildings."
"It requires supporting facilities, such as fire detection and alarm systems, to be provided and maintained."
"In a phased evacuation, the first people to be evacuated are those with reduced mobility and those on the storey most immediately affected by the fire."
"If needed, subsequent evacuation is done two floors at a time, reducing disruption in large buildings."
"Phased evacuation enables stairs to be narrower than with simultaneous evacuation, and may be used for any building provided it is not identified in paragraph 3.16."
Phased evacuation in buildings with a storey over 30m in height introduces the potential for escaping people to impede firefighters entering and operating within the building.
This can be addressed by consulting with the fire and rescue service about special management procedures.
"In very tall buildings, typically with a storey over 45m in height, physical measures may need to be incorporated, such as by discounting a stair."
A building (or part of a building) designed for phased evacuation should satisfy all of the following criteria.
"At each storey except a top storey, stairs should be approached through a protected lobby or protected corridor."
"At each storey, the lifts should be approached through a protected lobby (see paragraph 5.37)."
Every floor should be a compartment floor (REI depending on height and use of the building).
"If there is a storey over 30m above ground level, the building should be protected throughout by an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E."
The building should be fitted with an appropriate fire warning system conforming to at least the L3 standard given in BS 5839-1.
An internal speech communication system should provide communication between a control point at fire and rescue service access level and a fire warden on every storey.
The recommendations for phased evacuation provided in BS 5839-1 should be followed.
"Where it is deemed appropriate to install a voice alarm, this should be in accordance with BS 5839-8."
The minimum width of stairs needed for phased evacuation is given in Table 3.3.
This table assumes a phased evacuation of the fire floor first followed by evacuation of not more than two floors at a time.
"Unless a central handrail is provided, stairs with a rise of more than 30m should be a maximum width of 1400mm (see paragraph 3.10)."
"As an alternative to using this table, the minimum width (in mm) may be calculated from: (P10) – 100 where P = the number of people on the most heavily occupied storey."
"However, the minimum width of a stair should be 1000mm."
"What is the minimum width needed for the stairs serving a 15 storey office building (ground + 14 office floors), assuming a total population of 2500 people (excluding the ground floor population, which does not use the stairs)?"
"To satisfy the travel distance limitations, three stairs are required."
The building is over 45m in height and designed for phased evacuation.
It has been decided to discount one stair to take account of fire and rescue service operations as described in paragraph 3.20.
 Number of people per storey = 2500/14 = 179.
Each remaining stair must be able to accommodate half the population of one storey (i.e. 90 people).
Thus each stair should be 1000mm wide (maximum capacity 100 people).
This width will also be adequate when one storey exit is discounted as described in paragraph 2.21.
It also complies with paragraph 3.10a (i.e. the stair widths are not less than the minimum width needed for 90 people in Table 2.3).
" At least one of those stairs needs to be a firefighting stair, therefore a minimum width of 1100mm is needed (see note 2 to Table 3.1)."
"What is the minimum width needed for the stairs serving a 9 storey office building (ground + 8 office floors), assuming a total population of 1920 people (excluding the ground floor population, which does not use the stairs)?"
"To satisfy the travel distance limitations, two stairs are required."
"As both stairs need to be entered at each level through a protected lobby (see paragraph 3.21), both stairs can be assumed to be available (see paragraph 3.15)."
 Number of people per storey = 1920/8 = 240.
 Each stair must be able to accommodate half the population of one storey (i.e. 240/2 = 120 people).
" Thus both stairs would require a width of 1100mm (maximum capacity 120 people) according to Table 3.3, but:"
" Each storey exit needs to be able to serve 240 people, because of discounting as described in paragraph 2.21."
The minimum exit width needed for 240 people in Table 2.3 is 1200mm.
"As described in paragraph 3.10a, the stair should be at least as wide as the storey exit serving it."
 The required stair width is therefore 1200mm.
Every internal escape stair should be a protected stairway (within a fire resisting enclosure).
"If it is also a protected shaft (i.e. it passes from one compartment to another) or firefighting shaft, additional guidance in Sections 8 and 17 applies."
"There is one exception: an unprotected stair (e.g. an accommodation stair) may form part of an internal route to a storey exit or final exit, provided that the distance of travel and the number of people involved are very limited."
"For example, small premises (Section 4) and raised storage areas (see paragraphs 7.6 and 7.7)."
"The flights and landings of escape stairs should be constructed of materials achieving class A2-s3, d2 or better in all of the following situations."
"If the escape stair is the only stair serving the building or part of the building, unless the building has two or three storeys and is an office building."
If the escape stair is within a basement storey.
If the escape stair serves any storey that has a floor level more than 18m above ground or access level.
"If the escape stair is external, except where the stair connects the ground floor or ground level with a floor or flat roof a maximum of 6m above or below ground level."
If the escape stair is a firefighting stair.
"Materials achieving class B-s3, d2 or worse may be added to the top horizontal surface, except on firefighting stairs."
Further guidance on firefighting stairs is given in Section 17.
Dimensional constraints on the design of stairs are given in Approved Document K.
Single steps on escape routes should be prominently marked.
"A single step on the line of a doorway is acceptable, subject to paragraph 5.22."
Helical stairs and spiral stairs 3.27 Helical stairs and spiral stairs may form part of an escape route provided they are designed in accordance with BS 5395-2.
"If they are intended to serve members of the public, stairs should be type E (public) stairs."
Fixed ladders 3.28 Fixed ladders should not be provided as a means of escape for members of the public.
"They should only be provided where a conventional stair is impractical, such as for access to plant rooms which are not normally occupied."
"With some configurations of external wall, a fire in one part of a building could subject the external wall of a protected stairway to heat (for example, where the two are adjacent at an internal angle in the façade, as shown in Diagram 3.3)."
"If a protected stairway projects beyond, is recessed from or is in an internal angle of the adjoining external wall of the building, then the minimum distance between an unprotected area of the building enclosure and an unprotected area of the stair enclosure should be 1800mm."
"Where a storey or part of the building has more than one escape route available, some of the escape routes may be via an external escape stair, provided the following conditions are met."
There is at least one internal escape stair from every part of each storey (excluding plant areas).
"In the case of an ‘assembly and recreation’ (purpose group 5) building, the route is not intended for use by the public."
"In the case of a ‘residential (institutional)’ (purpose group 2(a)) building, the route serves only office or residential staff accommodation."
Any external escape stair should meet all of the following conditions (Diagram 3.4).
"leading external stair, provided it is the only door onto the landing."
"Fire resisting construction (minimum RE 30) is required for the building envelope within the following zones, measured from the flights and landings of the external stair."
1800mm above and horizontally.

Fire resisting construction (minimum RE 30) should be provided for any part of the building (including doors) within 1800mm of the escape route from the foot of the stair to a place of safety.
This does not apply if there are alternative escape routes from the foot of the external escape stair.
Stairs more than 6m in height should be protected from adverse weather.
Protection should prevent the build-up of snow or ice but does not require full enclosure.
"Glazing in areas of fire resisting construction should be fixed shut and fire resisting, in terms of integrity but not insulation (minimum E 30)."

A wall common to two or more buildings shall be designed and constructed so that it adequately resists the spread of fire between those buildings.
For the purposes of this sub-paragraph a house in a terrace and a semi-detached house are each to be treated as a separate building.
sub-division of the building with fire-resisting construction;
installation of suitable automatic fire suppression systems.
The building shall be designed and constructed so that the unseen spread of fire and smoke within concealed spaces in its structure and fabric is inhibited.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B3 is met by achieving all of the following."
"For defined periods, loadbearing elements of structure withstand the effects of fire without loss of stability."

"Inhibition of the unseen spread of fire and smoke in cavities, to reduce the risk of structural failure and spread of fire and smoke, where they pose a threat to the safety of people in and around the building."
"The extent to which any of these measures are necessary is dependent on the use of the building and, in some cases, its size, and on the location of the elements of construction."
"Elements of structure such as structural frames, beams, columns, loadbearing walls (internal and external), floor structures and gallery structures should have, as a minimum, the fire resistance given in Appendix B, Table B3."
Appendix B includes guidance on all of the following.
"Provisions to ensure that where one element of structure supports or stabilises another element of structure, the supporting element has no less fire resistance than the other element (see Table B4)."

Special provisions about fire resistance of elements of structure in single storey buildings.
Concessions in respect of fire resistance of elements of structure in basements where one or more sides of the basement are open at ground level.
The following are excluded from the definition of ‘element of structure’.
"A structure that supports only a roof, unless either of the following applies."
"The roof performs the function of a floor, such as for parking vehicles, or as a means of escape."
The structure is essential for the stability of an external wall that needs to be fire resisting (e.g. to achieve compartmentation or for the purposes of preventing fire spread between buildings).
The lowest floor of the building.
A platform floor.
"A loading gallery, fly gallery, stage grid, lighting bridge or any gallery provided for similar purposes or for maintenance and repair."
"External walls, such as curtain walls or other forms of cladding, which transmit only self weight and wind loads and do not transmit floor load."
"In some cases, structural members within a roof may be essential for the structural stability system of the building."
"In these cases, the structural members in the roof do not just support a roof and must demonstrate the relevant fire resistance for the building as required by paragraph 7.2a above."
"If a loadbearing wall is any of the following, guidance in other sections may also apply."

"If agreed with the building control body and the fire and rescue service, then it may be possible to vary this dimension and area."
"However, the safety of firefighters and the distance they may need to travel over or under the floor must be considered."
"If the building is fitted throughout with an automatic sprinkler system complying with Appendix E, then no limits are set for the size of the floor."
"All of the following should be provided as compartment walls and compartment floors and should have, as a minimum, the fire resistance given in Appendix B, Table B3."
A wall common to two or more buildings should be a compartment wall.
Parts of a building occupied mainly for different purposes should be separated from one another by compartment walls and/or compartment floors.
Compartmentation is not needed if one of the different purposes is ancillary to the other.

Effective compartmentation relies on both of the following.
Fire resistance should be continuous at the join between elements forming a compartment.
Any openings between two compartments should not reduce the fire resistance.
The lowest floor in a building does not need to be a compartment floor.
Stairs and service shafts connecting compartments should be protected to restrict the spread of fire between the compartments.
These are called protected shafts.
Walls or floors surrounding a protected shaft are considered to be compartment walls or compartment floors.
Fire resisting construction enclosing these places should achieve minimum REI 30.
These walls and floors are not compartment walls and compartment floors.
All floors should be constructed as compartment floors.
Paragraphs 2.35 and 2.36 give guidance on the provisions for compartment walls in care homes that use progressive horizontal evacuation.

Any attendant’s kiosk not exceeding 15m2 in area.
Any shop mobility facility.
"For car parks that do not have the ventilation set out in paragraph 11.2, the required fire resistance is given in Appendix B, Table B4."
Ventilation should be either natural or mechanical.
See Approved Document F for additional guidance on ventilation of car parks.
Each storey should be ventilated by permanent openings at each car parking level.
The openings can be at ceiling level.
"The aggregate free vent area should be a minimum of 1/40 of that level’s floor area, at least half of which should be provided equally by two opposite walls (1/160 on each side)."
The remaining free area can be distributed wherever possible.
"If the minimum standard of natural ventilation is not possible, a system of mechanical ventilation should be provided that complies with all of the following."
The system should be both of the following.
Independent of any other ventilating system (other than any system that provides day to day ventilation to the car park).
Designed to operate at 10 air changes per hour during a fire.
"The system should run in two parts, each of which is:"
provided with an independent power supply capable of operating if the main supply fails.
50% of the outlets should be at high level and 50% at low level.
"The system should use E, I and S ductwork in accordance with BS EN 1366-8."
"For further information on equipment for removing hot smoke, refer to BS EN 12101-3."
An alternative method of providing smoke ventilation from enclosed car parks is given in BS 7346-7.
These sections deal with the following requirement from Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
Section 12 also refers to regulation 7(2) of the Building Regulations 2010.
Guidance on regulation 7(1) can be found in Approved Document 7.
"The external walls of the building shall adequately resist the spread of fire over the walls and from one building to another having regard to the height, use and position of the building."
"The roof of the building shall adequately resist the spread of fire over the roof and from one building to another, having regard to the use and position of the building."
"are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used,"
"are adequately mixed or prepared, and"
"are applied, used or fixed so as adequately to perform the functions for which they are designed; and"
in a workmanlike manner.
"Building work shall be carried out so that relevant metal composite material does not become part of an external wall, or specified attachment, of any building."
"Subject to paragraph (3), building work shall be carried out so that materials which become part of an external wall, or specified attachment, of a relevant building are of European Classification A2-s1, d0 or A1 (classified in accordance with the reaction to fire classification)."
cavity trays when used between two leaves of masonry;
any part of a roof (other than any part of a roof which falls within paragraph (iv) of regulation 2(6)) if that part is connected to an external wall;
door frames and doors;
fibre optic cables;
insulation and water proofing materials used below ground level or up to 300mm above that level;
intumescent and fire stopping materials where the inclusion of the materials is necessary to meet the requirements of Part B of Schedule 1;
"seals, gaskets, fixings, sealants and backer rods;"

contains one or more dwellings;
contains an institution; or
contains a room for residential purposes; and
“above ground level” in relation to a storey means above ground level when measured from the lowest ground level adjoining the outside of a building to the top of the floor surface of the storey.
The external envelope of a building should not contribute to undue fire spread from one part of a building to another part.
This intention can be met by constructing external walls so that both of the following are satisfied.
The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building and spread of fire over the outside surface is restricted.
"The materials used to construct external walls, and attachments to them, and how they are assembled do not contribute to the rate of fire spread up the outside of the building."
The extent to which this is necessary depends on the height and use of the building.
The external envelope of a building should not provide a medium for undue fire spread to adjacent buildings or be readily ignited by fires in adjacent buildings.
This intention can be met by constructing external walls so that all of the following are satisfied.
The risk of ignition by an external source to the outside surface of the building is restricted.
The amount of thermal radiation that falls on a neighbouring building from window openings and other unprotected areas in the building on fire is not enough to start a fire in the other building.
Flame spread over the roof and/or fire penetration from external sources through the roof is restricted.
The extent to which this is necessary depends on the use of the building and its position in relation to adjacent buildings and therefore the site boundary.
The external wall of a building should not provide a medium for fire spread if that is likely to be a risk to health and safety.
"Combustible materials and cavities in external walls and attachments to them can present such a risk, particularly in tall buildings."
The guidance in this section is designed to reduce the risk of fire spread as well as the risk of ignition from flames coming from adjacent buildings.
"This section provides guidance on resisting fire spread over external walls; however, it does not deal with fire resistance of external walls."
"An external wall may need fire resistance to meet the provisions of Section 2 (Design for horizontal escape), Section 3 (Design for vertical escape), Section 7 (Loadbearing elements of structure), Section 13 (Resisting fire spread from one building to another) or Section 17 (Access to buildings for firefighting personnel)."
The external walls of buildings other than those described in regulation 7(4) of the Building Regulations should achieve either of the following.
"Follow the provisions given in paragraphs 12.5 to 12.10, which provide guidance on all of the following."
Materials and products.
Cavities and cavity barriers.
Meet the performance criteria given in BRE report BR 135 for external walls using full-scale test data from BS 8414-1 or BS 8414-2.
"In relation to buildings of any height or use, consideration should be given to the choice of materials (including their extent and arrangement) used for the external wall, or attachments to the wall (e.g. balconies, etc.), to reduce the risk of fire spread over the wall."
The external surfaces (i.e. outermost external material) of external walls should comply with the provisions in Table 12.1.
The provisions in Table 12.1 apply to each wall individually in relation to its proximity to the relevant boundary.
In all cases all the following provisions apply.
" Regulation 7(1A) prohibits the use of relevant metal composite materials in the external walls, and specified attachments, of all buildings of any height (see paragraphs 12.12 and 12.13)."
 The advice in paragraph 12.4 should always be followed.
"In addition to the provisions within this table, buildings with a storey 18m or more above ground level should also meet the provisions of paragraph 12.6."
"In addition to the provisions within this table, buildings with a storey 11m or more above ground level should also meet the provisions of paragraph 12.7."
The restrictions for these buildings apply to all the materials used in the external wall and specified attachments (see paragraphs 12.14 to 12.17 for further guidance).
Profiled or flat steel sheet at least 0.5 mm thick with an organic coating of no more than 0.2mm thickness is also acceptable.
Timber cladding at least 9mm thick is also acceptable.
10m is measured from the top surface of the roof.
"In a building with a storey 18m or more in height (see Diagram D6 in Appendix D) any insulation product, filler material (such as the core materials of metal composite panels, sandwich panels and window spandrel panels but not including gaskets, sealants and similar) etc. used in the construction of an external wall should be class A2-s3, d2 or better (see Appendix B)."
This restriction does not apply to masonry cavity wall construction which complies with Diagram 9.2 in Section 9.
"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph."
"In buildings that include a ‘residential’ purpose (purpose groups 1 and 2) with a storey 11m or more in height (see Diagram D6 in Appendix D) any insulation product, filler material (such as the core materials of metal composite panels, sandwich panels and window spandrel panels but not including gaskets, sealants and similar) etc. used in the construction of an external wall should be class A2-s1, d0 or better (see Appendix B)."
This restriction does not apply to masonry cavity wall construction which complies with Diagram 9.2 in Section 9.
"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph."
"Best practice guidance for green walls (also called living walls) can be found in Fire Performance of Green Roofs and Walls, published by the Department for Communities and Local Government."
"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph."
"In the case of an external wall construction of a building which, by virtue of paragraph 9.10d (external cladding system with a masonry or concrete inner leaf), is not subject to the provisions of Table 9.1, the surfaces which face into cavities should also meet the provisions of Table 12.1 and provisions in Section 9, but where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over the guidance provided in Table 12.1 and Section 9."
Balconies 12.11 In buildings that include a ‘residential’ purpose (purpose groups 1 and 2) with a storey 11m or more in height (see Diagram D6 in Appendix D) balconies should meet either of the following conditions.
"Only contain materials achieving class A1 or A2-s1, d0, except for any of the following."
Cavity trays when used between two leaves of masonry.
Intumescent and fire-stopping materials where the inclusion of the materials is necessary to meet the requirements of Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
"Seals, gaskets, fixings, sealants and backer rods."
Thermal break materials where the inclusion of the materials is necessary to meet the thermal bridging requirements of Part L of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
Any material achieving class A1fl or A2fl-s1 when it forms the top horizontal floor layer of a balcony and is provided with an imperforate substrate under it which extends to the full size of the class A1fl or A2fl-s1 material.
Fibre optic cables.
Achieve both of the following conditions.
"Have an imperforate soffit which extends to the full area of the balcony, achieves a minimum REI 30 rating and is constructed of materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or better."
"Materials achieving class B-s1, d0 or worse extending beyond the boundary of a single compartment should include a band of material rated class A2-s1, d0 or better, a minimum of 300mm in width centred on that boundary line."
"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over all the provisions in this paragraph."
"Metal composite materials 12.12 Regulation 7(1A) prohibits the use of relevant metal composite materials in the external walls, and specified attachments, of all buildings of any height."
"Relevant metal composite materials are defined (in regulation 2(6)(c)) as any panel or sheet, having a thickness of no more than 10mm which is composed of a number of layers two or more of which are made of metal, alloy or metal compound and one or more of which is a substantial layer made of a material having a gross calorific value of more than 35MJ/kg when tested in accordance with BS EN ISO 1716."
A substantial layer is defined as a layer which is at least 1mm thick or has a mass per unit area of at least 1kg/m².
Materials 12.14 Regulation 7(1)(a) requires that materials used in building work are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used.
Regulation 7(2) sets requirements in respect of external walls and specified attachments in relevant buildings.
Further guidance on regulation 7(1) can be found in HM Government’s Manual to the Building Regulations.
Regulation 7(2) applies to any building with a storey at least 18m above ground level (as measured in accordance with Diagram D6 in Appendix D) and which contains one or more dwellings; an institution; or a room for residential purposes.
"It requires that all materials which become part of an external wall or specified attachment achieve class A2-s1, d0 or class A1 in accordance with BS EN 13501-1, other than those exempted by regulation 7(3)."
"The above includes student accommodation, care homes, sheltered housing, hospitals, dormitories in boarding schools, hotels, hostels and boarding houses."
See regulation 7(4) for the definition of relevant buildings.
Transposition to a national class (Table B1) does not apply to the classification in this paragraph.
"External walls and specified attachments are defined in regulation 2(6) and these definitions include any parts of the external wall as well as balconies, solar panels and solar shading."
Regulation 7(3) provides an exemption for certain components found in external walls and specified attachments.
"Regulations 5(k) and 6(3) provide that, where the use of a building is changed such that the building becomes a building described in regulation 7(4), the construction of the external walls, and specified attachments, must be investigated and, where necessary, work must be carried out to ensure they only contain materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or class A1, other than those exempted by regulation 7(3)."
"Solar shading devices 12.19 Regulation 7(2) requires that the curtain and or slats of solar shading devices in a relevant building (as defined in regulation 7(4)) achieve class A1 or A2-s1, d0."
The curtain of solar shading devices cannot be classified as a membrane in accordance with regulation 7(3).
Solar shading devices installed up to 4.5m above ground level are not required to meet the requirements of regulation 7(2).
The provisions of regulation 7 apply in addition to requirement B4.
"Therefore, for buildings described in regulation 7(4), the potential impact of any products incorporated into or onto the external walls and specified attachments should be carefully considered with regard to their number, size, orientation and position."
Particular attention is drawn to the following points.
"Membranes used as part of the external wall construction above ground level should achieve a minimum of class B-s3, d0."
"Roofing membranes do not need to achieve a minimum of class A2-s1, d0 when used as part of a roof connecting to an external wall."
Internal linings should comply with the guidance provided in Section 4. c. Any part of a roof should achieve the minimum performance as detailed in Section 12.
"As per regulation 7(3), window frames and glass (including laminated glass) are exempted from regulation 7(2)."
Window spandrel panels and infill panels must comply with regulation 7(2).
Thermal breaks are small elements used as part of the external wall construction to restrict thermal bridging.
There is no minimum performance for these materials.
"However, they should not span two compartments and should be limited in size to the minimum required to restrict the thermal bridging (the principal insulation layer is not to be regarded as a thermal break)."
Regulation 7(2) only applies to specified attachments.
"Shop front signs and similar attachments are not covered by the requirements of regulation 7(2), although attention is drawn to paragraph 12.22g."
"While regulation 7(2) applies to materials which become part of an external wall or specified attachment, consideration should be given to other attachments to the wall which could impact on the risk of fire spread over the wall."
Any material achieving class A1fl or A2fl-s1 in accordance with BS EN 13501-1 is exempted when it meets both of the following conditions.
It forms the top horizontal floor layer of a balcony.
It is provided with an imperforate substrate under it which extends to the full size of the class A1fl or A2fl-s1 material.
The following assumptions enable a reasonable standard of resistance to the spread of fire to be specified.
The size of a fire depends on the compartmentation within the building.
"A fire may involve a complete compartment, but will not spread to other compartments."
"The intensity of fire is related to the building use, but can be moderated by a sprinkler system."
"Fires in ‘residential’ and ‘assembly and recreation’ buildings (purposes groups 1, 2 and 5) represent a greater risk to life."
A building on the far side of the relevant boundary meets both of the following conditions.
Has a similar elevation to the one in question.
Is at the same distance from the common boundary.
The radiated heat passing through any part of the fire resisting external wall may be discounted.
"Where regulation 7(2) applies, that regulation prevails over the provisions within this section."
"If a reduced separation distance between buildings, or increased amount of unprotected area, is required, smaller compartments should be considered."
The fire resistance of a wall depends on its distance from the relevant boundary (see Diagram 13.1).
Separation distances are measured to boundaries to ensure that the location and design of buildings on adjoining sites have no influence on the building under consideration.
The boundary that a wall faces is the relevant boundary (Diagram 13.2).
It may be one of the following.
The site boundary.
"The centre line of a space where further development is unlikely, such as a road, railway, canal or river."
An assumed notional boundary between two buildings on the same site (Diagram 13.3) where either of the following conditions is met.
"One or both of the buildings are in the ‘residential’ or ‘assembly and recreation’ purpose groups (purpose group 1, 2 or 5)."
The buildings will be operated/managed by different organisations.
Coincide with the side of the building (A).
Be parallel to the side of the building (B1 or B2).
 at an angle of maximum of degrees to the side the building (C).
Compliance with the provisions for space separation in respect of building A
Compliance with the provisions for space separation in respect of building B
The notional boundary should be set in the area between the two buildings using the following rules:
The notional boundary is assumed to exist in the space between the buildings and is positioned so that one of the buildings would comply with the provisions for space separation having regard to the amount of its unprotected area.
"In practice, if one of the buildings is existing, the position of the boundary will be set by the space separation factors for that building."
"The siting of the new building, or the second building if both are new, can then be checked to see that it also complies, using the notional boundary as the relevant boundary for the second building."
"Parts of an external wall with less fire resistance than the appropriate amount given in Appendix B, Table B4, are called unprotected areas."
"Where a fire resisting external wall has an external surface material that is worse than class B-s3, d2 and is more than 1mm thick, that part of the wall should be classified as an unprotected area equating to half its area (Diagram 13.4)."
Unprotected areas should meet the conditions in Diagram 13.5 and the rest of the wall should be fire resisting from both sides.
"External surface materials facing the boundary should be class B-s3, d2 or better."
"Unprotected area should not exceed the result given by one of the methods in paragraph 13.17, and the rest of the wall (if any) should be fire resisting but only from the inside of the building."
"In an otherwise protected wall, small unprotected areas may be ignored where they meet the conditions in Diagram 13.5."
"For the purposes of assessing unprotected area, parts of walls of uncompartmented buildings that are more than 30m above mean ground level may be ignored."
"Where both of the following apply, separation distances may be determined from the wall rather than from the edge of the canopy (Diagram 13.6)."
The canopy is attached to the side of a building.
The edges of the canopy are a minimum of 2m from the relevant boundary.
Canopies that fall within class 6 or class 7 of Schedule 2 to the regulations (Exempt Buildings and Work) are exempt from the Building Regulations.
Space separation may be disregarded if a canopy is all of the following.
"Above a limited risk or controlled hazard, for example over petrol pumps."
A minimum of 1000mm from the relevant boundary.
"Projections from the building line, such as a canopy or a loading platform, can be ignored when assessing separation distance."
This does not apply where the canopy is enclosed by side walls.
Roofs with a pitch of more than 70 degrees to the horizontal should be assessed in accordance with this section.
"Vertical parts of a pitched roof, such as dormer windows, should be included, only if the slope of the roof exceeds 70 degrees."
It is a matter of judgement whether a continuous run of dormer windows that occupies most of a steeply pitched roof should be treated as a wall rather than a roof.
Portal frames are often used in single storey industrial and commercial buildings where there may be no need for fire resistance of the structure (requirement B3).
"However, where a portal framed building is near a relevant boundary, the external wall near the boundary may need fire resistance to restrict the spread of fire between buildings."
"It is generally accepted that a portal frame acts as a single structural element because of the moment-resisting connections used, especially at the column/rafter joints."
"Thus, in cases where the external wall of the building cannot be wholly unprotected, the rafter members of the frame, as well as the column members, may need to be fire protected."
The design method for this is set out in SCI Publication P313.
The recommendations in the SCI publication for designing the foundation to resist overturning do not need to be followed if the building is fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.
"Normally, portal frames of reinforced concrete can support external walls requiring a similar degree of fire resistance without specific provision at the base to resist overturning."
"Existing buildings may have been designed to comply with all of the following guidance, which is also acceptable."
The column members are fixed rigidly to a base of sufficient size and depth to resist overturning.
"There is brick, block or concrete protection to the columns up to a protected ring beam providing lateral support."
There is some form of roof venting to give early heat release.
Two simple methods are given for calculating the acceptable amount of unprotected area in an external wall that is a minimum of 1000mm from any point on the relevant boundary.
More precise methods are described in BRE report BR 187 and may be used instead.
When using BR 187 the following radiation intensity at each unprotected area should be assumed.
"84kW/m2 if the purpose group of the building is ‘residential’ (purpose groups 1 or 2), ‘office’ (purpose group 3) or ‘assembly and recreation’ (purpose group 5) or if the building is an open-sided multi-storey car park (purpose group 7(b))."
"168kW/m2 if the purpose group of the building is ‘shop and commercial’ (purpose group 4), ‘industrial’ (purpose group 6) or ‘storage and other non-residential’ (purpose group 7(a))."
This method applies to small buildings intended to be used for ‘residential (other)’ purposes.
The building should not exceed three storeys in height (excluding basements) or 24m in length.
Each side of the building should meet the limits stated in Diagram 13.7.
Any small unprotected areas falling within the limits shown in Diagram 13.5 can be ignored.
This method may be used for buildings or compartments intended for any use and for which method 1 is not appropriate.
"Except for an open-sided car park in purpose group 7(b) (see paragraph 11.2), the building should not exceed 10m in height."
Each side of the building should meet the limits in Table 13.1.
Areas falling within the limits in Diagram 13.5 can be ignored.
Intermediate values may be obtained by interpolation.
"For buildings fitted with an automatic sprinkler system, see paragraph 13.22."
"For open-sided car parks in purpose group 7(b), the distances set out in column (1) may be used instead of those in column (2)."
"The total percentage of unprotected area is found by dividing the total unprotected area by the area of a rectangle that encloses all the unprotected areas, and multiplying the result by 100."
"If a building is fitted throughout with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E, either of the following is permitted."
"The boundary distance can be halved, to a minimum distance of 1m."
The amount of unprotected area can be doubled.
"If a building contains one or more atria, the recommendations in clause B8 of BS 9999 should be followed."
Provisions for the fire properties of roofs are given in other parts of this document.
"‘Roof covering’ describes one or more layers of material, but not the roof structure as a whole."
Requirement B1 – for roofs that are part of a means of escape.
Requirement B2 – for the internal surfaces of rooflights as part of internal linings.
Requirement B3 – for roofs that are used as a floor and for roofs passing over a compartment wall.
Section 13 – the circumstances in which a roof is subject to the provisions for space separation.
"Separation distance is the minimum distance from the roof, or part of the roof, to the relevant boundary (paragraph 13.5)."
Table 14.1 sets out separation distances by the type of roof covering and the size and use of the building.
"EC of 6 September 2000, implementing Council Directive 89/106/EEC, can be considered to fulfil all of the requirements for the performance characteristic ‘external fire performance’ without the need for testing, provided that any national provisions on the design and execution of works are fulfilled, and can be used without restriction."
The performance of rooflights is specified in a similar way to the performance of roof coverings.
Plastic rooflights may also be used.
"Table 14.2 and Diagram 14.1 set the limitations for using plastic rooflights whose lower surface has a minimum rating of class D-s3, d2."
Table 14.3 sets the limitations for using thermoplastic materials with a TP(a) rigid or TP(b) (see also Diagram 14.1) classification.
The method of classifying thermoplastic materials is given in Appendix B.
"Other than for the purposes of Diagram 8.2, polycarbonate or uPVC rooflights achieving a minimum rating of class C-s3, d2 can be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification."
"When used in rooflights, unwired glass a minimum of 4mm thick can be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification."
"If the performance of thatch or wood shingles cannot be established, they should be regarded as having an EROOF(t4) classification in Table 14.1."
"Class D-s3, d2 rooflights to rooms in industrial and other non-residential purpose groups may be spaced 1800mm apart provided the rooﬂights are evenly distributed and"
There are restrictions on the use of plastic rooflights in the guidance to requirement B2 in Section 6.
"Surrounding roof covering to be class B-s3, d2 for at least 3m distance."
"Where Diagram 8.2a or 8.2b applies, rooﬂights should be at least 1500mm from the compartment wall."
Not acceptable.
Separation distances do not apply to enclosed/covered walkways.
"However, see Diagram 8.2 if the roof passes over the top of a compartment wall."
"Polycarbonate and uPVC rooflights that achieve a class C-s3, d2 rating by test may be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification."
Not acceptable on any of the following buildings.
"Industrial, storage or other non-residential purpose group (purpose groups 6 and 7) buildings of any size."
Any other buildings with a cubic capacity of more than 1500m3.
Acceptable on buildings not listed in (2) if both of the following apply.
Part of the roof has a maximum area of 3m2 and is a minimum of 1500mm from any similar part.
"The roof between the parts is covered with a material rated class A2-s3, d2 or better."
Minimum distance from any point on relevant boundary to rooflight with an external designation(2) of:
None of the above designations are suitable for protected stairways.
"Polycarbonate and uPVC rooflights that achieve a class C-s3, d2 rating by test (see paragraph 14.7) may be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) classification."
"Where Diagram 8.2a or 8.2b applies, rooflights should be a minimum of 1500m from the compartment wall."
"If double-skinned or laminate products have upper and lower surfaces of different materials, the greater distance applies."
See also the guidance to requirement B2 in Section 6.
The designation of external roof surfaces is explained in Appendix B.
"Single-skinned rooflight only, in the case of non-thermoplastic material."
The rooflight should also meet the provisions of Diagram 14.1.
Minimum distance from any point on relevant boundary to rooflight with an external surface classification(1) of:
None of the above designations are suitable for protected stairways.
"Polycarbonate and uPVC rooflights that achieve a class C-s3, d2 rating by test may be regarded as having a BROOF(t4) designation."
"Where Diagram 8.2a or 8.2b applies, rooflights should be at least 1500mm from the compartment wall."
"If double-skinned or laminate products have upper and lower surfaces of different materials, the greater distance applies."
See also the guidance to requirement B2 in Section 6.
"No limit in the case of any space described in 2(a), (b) and (c)."
"Single-skinned rooflight only, in the case of non-thermoplastic material."
The rooflight should also meet the provisions of Diagram 14.1.
These sections deal with the following requirement from Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
The building shall be designed and constructed so as to provide reasonable facilities to assist fire fighters in the protection of life.
Reasonable provision shall be made within the site of the building to enable fire appliances to gain access to the building.
Provisions covering access and facilities for the fire service are to safeguard the health and safety of people in and around the building.
Their extent depends on the size and use of the building.
Most firefighting is carried out within the building.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement B5 is met by achieving all of the following."
External access enabling fire appliances to be used near the building.
Access into and within the building for firefighting personnel to both:
Provision for internal fire facilities for firefighters to complete their tasks.
Ventilation of heat and smoke from a fire in a basement.
"If an alternative approach is taken to providing the means of escape, outside the scope of this approved document, additional provisions for firefighting access may be required."
"Where deviating from the general guidance, it is advisable to seek advice from the fire and rescue service as early as possible (even if there is no statutory duty to consult)."
"For small buildings (up to 2000m2, with a top storey that is a maximum of 11m above ground level), vehicle access for a pump appliance should be provided to whichever is the less onerous of the following."
15% of the perimeter.
Within 45m of every point of the footprint of the building (see Diagram 15.1).
"For all other buildings, provide vehicle access in accordance with Table 15.1."
"Every elevation to which vehicle access is provided should have a door, a minimum of 750mm wide, to give access into the building."
"The maximum distance between doors, or between a door and the end of the elevation, is 60m (e.g. a 150m elevation would need a minimum of two doors)."
Provide vehicle access to:
The sum of the area of all storeys in the building (excluding basements).
"For storage buildings (purpose group 7(a)), measure height to mean roof level (see Appendix D)."
Plan of building AFGL where AL and FG are walls in common with other buildings.
The footprint of the building is the maximum aggregate plan perimeter found by the vertical projection of any overhanging storey onto a ground storey (i.e. ABCDEFGHMNKL).
"The perimeter of the building for the purposes of Table 15.1 is the sum of the lengths of the two external walls, taking account of the footprint, i.e. (A to B to C to D to E to F) + (G to H to M to N to K to L)."
"If the dimensions of the building are such that Table 15.1 requires vehicle access, the green shaded area illustrates one possible example of 15% of the perimeter."
Note: There should be a door into the building in this length (see paragraph 15.3).
"If the building does not have walls in common with other buildings, the lengths AL and FG would be included in the perimeter."
"For buildings fitted with dry fire mains, both of the following apply."

This does not include windows that are designed and glazed to give the necessary level of fire resistance and that are not openable.
Recessed car parking areas as shown in Diagram A1 should not be regarded as unprotected areas.
The parking area should be both of the following:
Separated from the remainder of the building by a compartment wall(s) and floor(s) having not less than the period of fire resistance specified in Table B4 in Appendix B.
Much of the guidance in this document is given in terms of performance classifications in relation to British or European Standards.
"In such cases, it will be necessary to demonstrate that a system or product can meet the relevant performance classification."
This will be achieved if the system or product complies with one of the following.
They should be in accordance with a specification or design that has been shown by a specific test to be capable of meeting that performance classification.
They should have been designed by using relevant design standards in order to meet that performance classification.
"They should have been assessed by applying relevant test evidence, in lieu of carrying out a specific test, as being capable of meeting that performance classification."
Some products are subject to Classification Without Further Testing (CWFT).
"For the purposes of this approved document, such products can be considered to have been shown to be capable of meeting a performance specification as per paragraph B1a."
Any test evidence used to demonstrate the fire performance classification of a product or system should be carefully checked to ensure that it is applicable to the intended use.
"Small differences in detail, such as fixing method, joints, dimensions, the introduction of insulation materials and air gaps (ventilated or not), can significantly affect the performance."
Assessments should not be regarded as a way to avoid a test where one is necessary.
Assessments should only be carried out where sufficient relevant test evidence is available.
Relevant test evidence is unlikely to be provided by test standards which have different classification criteria.
"Where it is proposed to assess the classification of a product or system in lieu of carrying out a specific test (as in paragraph B1c), this should be done in accordance with the relevant standard for extended application for the test in question and should include details of the test evidence that has been used to support the assessment."
"For performance classifications where there is no specific standard for extended application, assessment reports should be produced in accordance with the principles of BS EN 15725 and should include details of the test evidence that has been used to support the assessment."
Further information on best practice is provided in the Passive Fire Protection Forum’s Guide to Undertaking Technical Assessments of the Fire Performance of Construction Products Based on Fire Test Evidence.
"Regulation 7(2) limits components used in or on the external walls of certain buildings to materials achieving class A2-s1, d0 or class A1 (see Section 12)."
Assessments cannot be used to demonstrate compliance with this requirement.
Tests and assessments should be carried out by organisations with the necessary expertise.
Products Regulation or laboratories accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) for the relevant test standard can be assumed to have the necessary expertise.
Standard fire tests do not directly measure fire hazard.
They measure or assess the response of a material or system to exposure to one or more aspects of fire conditions.
Performance in fire tests is only one of a number of factors that should be taken into account.
"Reaction to fire relates to the degree to which a product will contribute, by its own decomposition, to a fire under specified conditions."
"Products, other than floorings, are classified as A1, A2, B, C, D, E or F (with class A1 being the highest performance and F being the lowest) in accordance with BS EN 13501-1."
Class F is assigned when a product fails to attain class E. Untested products cannot be classified in accordance with BS EN 13501-1.
Materials covered by the Classification Without Further Testing (CWFT) process can be found by accessing the European Commission’s website https://eur-lex.europa.eu/.
"The classes of reaction to fire performance of A2, B, C, D and E are accompanied by additional classifications related to the production of smoke (s1, s2, s3), with s1 indicating the lowest production, and/or flaming droplets/particles (d0, d1, d2), with d0 indicating the lowest production."
"When a classification includes s3, d2 this means that there is no limit set for smoke production and/or flaming droplets/particles."
"To reduce the testing burden on manufacturers, BS EN 13238 defines a number of standard substrates that produce test results representative of different end use applications."
"The classification for reaction to fire achieved during testing is only valid when the product is used within this field of application, i.e. when the product is fixed to a substrate of that class in its end use."
The standard substrate selected for testing should take account of the intended end use applications (field of application) of the product and represent end use substrates that have a density of a minimum of 75% of the standard substrate’s nominal density.
"Standard substrates include gypsum plasterboard (BS EN 520) with a density of 700+/-100kg/m3, calcium silicate board (BS EN 14306) 870+/-50kg/m3 and fibre-cement board 1800+/-200kg/m3."
"Standard calcium silicate board is not representative of gypsum plasterboard end use (due to the paper layer), but would be representative of most gypsum plasters (with densities of more than 650kg/m3)."
Classifications based on tests using a plasterboard substrate would also be acceptable for products bonded to a gypsum plaster end use substrate.
"This document uses the European classification system for reaction to fire set out in BS EN 13501-1; however, there may be some products lawfully on the market using the classification system set out in previous editions."
"Where this is the case, Table B1 can be used for the purposes of this document."
"Material that, when tested to BS 476-11, does not either:"
Material that meets either of the following.
"Any material of density 300kg/m3 or more, which, when tested to BS 476-11, complies with both of the following:"
"Any material of density less than 300kg/m3, which, when tested to BS 476-11, complies with both of the following:"
Any material that meets both of the following criteria.
Class 1 in accordance with BS 476-7.
"Has a fire propagation index (I) of a maximum of 12 and sub-index (i1) of a maximum of 6, determined by using the method given in BS 476-6."
"The national classifications do not automatically equate with the transposed classifications in the ‘BS EN 13501-1 classification’ column, therefore products cannot typically assume a European class unless they have been tested accordingly."
"A classification of s3, d2 indicates that no limit is set for production of smoke and/or flaming droplets/particles."
"If a performance for production of smoke and/or flaming droplets/particles is specified, then only the European classes can be used."
"For example, a national class may not be used as an alternative to a classification which includes s1, d0."
Thermoplastic material is any synthetic polymeric material that has a softening point below 200°C if tested to BS EN ISO 306 Method A120.
Products formed from these materials cannot always be classified in the normal way.
In those circumstances the following approach can be followed.
"Thermoplastic materials used for window glazing, rooflights and lighting diffusers within suspended ceilings do not need to meet the criteria within paragraph B19 onwards, if the guidance to requirements B2 and B4 is followed."
"For the purposes of requirements B2 and B4, thermoplastic materials should be classified as TP(a) rigid, TP(a) flexible or TP(b), as follows:"
"any other rigid thermoplastic product, a specimen of which (at the thickness of the product as put on the market), when tested to BS 2782-0 Method 508A, performs so that both:   the test flame extinguishes before the first mark the duration of flaming or afterglow does not exceed 5 seconds following removal of the burner."
"Flexible products a maximum of 1mm thick that comply with the Type C requirements of BS 5867-2 when tested to BS 5438 Test 2 with the flame applied to the surface of the specimens for 5, 15, 20 and 30 seconds respectively, but excluding the cleansing procedure; and"
"other products which, when a specimen of the material between 1.5 and 3mm thick is tested in accordance with BS 2782-0 Method 508A, have a maximum rate of burning of 50mm/minute."
"If it is not possible to cut or machine a 3mm thick specimen from the product, then a 3mm test specimen can be moulded from the same material as that used to manufacture the product."
A thermoplastic material alone when used as a lining to a wall or ceiling cannot be assumed to protect a substrate.
The surface rating of both thermoplastic material and substrate must therefore meet the required classification.
"If, however, the thermoplastic material is fully bonded to a non-thermoplastic substrate, then only the surface rating of the composite needs to meet the required classification."
Performance of the resistance of roofs to external fire exposure is measured in terms of penetration through the roof construction and the spread of flame over its surface.
"Roof constructions are classified within the European system as BROOF(t4), CROOF(t4), DROOF(t4), EROOF(t4) or FROOF(t4) in accordance with BS EN 13501-5. BROOF(t4) indicates the highest performance and FROOF(t4) the lowest."
BS EN 13501-5 refers to four separate roof tests.
The suffix (t4) used in paragraph B16 indicates that Test 4 is to be used for the purposes of this approved document.
"This document uses the European classification system for roof covering set out in BS EN 13501-5; however, there may be some products lawfully on the market using the classification system set out in previous editions."
"Where this is the case, Table B2 can be used for the purposes of this document."
"The national classifications do not automatically equate with the transposed classifications in the European column, therefore products cannot typically assume a European class unless they have been tested accordingly."
Common to all of the provisions of Part B of the Building Regulations is the property of fire resistance.
Fire resistance is a measure of one or more of the following.
"Resistance to collapse (loadbearing capacity), which applies to loadbearing elements only, denoted R in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance."
"Resistance to fire penetration (integrity), denoted E in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance."
"Resistance to the transfer of excessive heat (insulation), denoted I in the European classification of the resistance to fire performance."
The standards of fire resistance necessary for a particular building are based on assumptions about the severity of fires and the consequences should an element fail.
"Fire severity is estimated in very broad terms from the use of the building (its purpose group), on the assumption that the building contents (which constitute the fire load) are similar for buildings with the same use."
"Because the use of buildings may change, a precise estimate of fire severity based on the fire load due to a particular use may be misleading."
"Therefore if a fire engineering approach of this kind is adopted, the likelihood that the fire load may change in the future needs to be considered."
"Performance in terms of the fire resistance to be achieved by elements of structure, doors and other forms of construction is classified in accordance with one of the following."
Fire resistance is measured in minutes.
This relates to time elapsed in a standard test and should not be confused with real time.
The fire resistance necessary for different circumstances is set out in the following tables.
Table B3 gives the specific requirements for each element of structure.
Table B4 sets out the minimum periods of fire resistance for elements of structure.
Table B5 sets out limitations on the use of uninsulated fire resisting glazed elements.
"This document uses the European classification system for fire resistance set out in BS EN 13501-2 to 4; however, there may be some products lawfully on the market using the classification system set out in previous editions."
In those situations the alternative classifications given in Table B3 can be used.
"Structural frame, beam or column."
"Loadbearing wall (for a wall which is also described in any of the following items, the more onerous guidance should be applied)."
any other floor – including compartment floors.
any roof that performs the function of a floor.
"any part beside an external escape route (Section 2 Diagram 2.7 of Approved Document B Volume 1 and Section 3, Diagram 3.4)."
Compartment walls Separating either:
Compartment walls (other than in item 6 or item 10).
Excluding any firefighting shaft:
any part not described in (a) or (b) above.

"construction that separates firefighting stair, firefighting lift shaft and firefighting lobby."
Enclosure (that is not a compartment wall or described in item 8) to a:
Sub-division of a corridor
construction that encloses bedrooms and ancillary accommodation in care homes.
"Enclosure in a flat to a protected entrance hall, or to a protected landing."

Duct described in paragraph 9.17e.
Casing around a drainage system described in Diagram 9.1 of Approved Document B Volume 1.
Flue walls described in Diagram 10.4.
Construction described in note (a) to paragraph 12.9 of Approved Document B Volume 1.

"BS EN 13501-2 Classification using data from fire resistance tests, excluding ventilation services."
BS EN 13501-3 Classification using data from fire resistance tests on products and elements used in building service installations: fire resisting ducts and fire dampers.
BS EN 13501-4 Classification using data from fire resistance tests on components of smoke control systems.
In the European classification: ‘R’ is the resistance to fire in terms of loadbearing capacity.
‘E’ is the resistance to fire in terms of integrity.
‘I’ is the resistance to fire in terms of insulation.
"The national classifications do not automatically equate with the alternative classifications in the European column, therefore products cannot typically assume a European class unless they have been tested accordingly."
"BS 476-20 for general principles, BS 476-21 for loadbearing elements, BS 476-22 for non-loadbearing elements, BS 476-23 for fire-protecting suspended ceilings and BS 476-24 for ventilation ducts."
Applies to loadbearing elements only (see paragraph B19).
Guidance on increasing the fire resistance of existing timber floors is given in BRE Digest 208.
Only if a suspended ceiling meets the appropriate provisions should it be relied on to add to the fire resistance of the floor.
Such walls may contain areas that do not need to be fire resisting (unprotected areas).
Unless needed as part of a wall in item 5a or 5b.
Except for any limitations on uninsulated glazed elements given in Table B5.

"For single storey buildings, the periods under the heading ‘Up to 5’ apply."
"If single storey buildings have basements, for the basement storeys the period appropriate to their depth applies."
"For the floor over a basement or, if there is more than one basement, the floor over the topmost basement, the higher of the period for the basement storey and the period for the ground or upper storey applies."
"† For compartment walls that separate buildings, the period is increased to a minimum of 60 minutes."
"For any floor that does not contribute to the support of the building within a flat of more than one storey, the period is reduced to 30 minutes."
"For flat conversions, refer to paragraphs 6.5 to 6.7 of Approved Document B Volume 1 regarding the acceptability of 30 minutes."
"For elements that do not form part of the structural frame, the period is reduced to 90 minutes."
"For elements that protect the means of escape, the period is increased to 30 minutes."
"Refer to note 1, Table B3 for the specific provisions of test."
Blocks of flats with a top storey more than 11m above ground level (see Diagram D6) should be fitted with a sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.
"Sprinklers should be provided within the individual flats, they do not need to be provided in the common areas such as stairs, corridors or landings when these areas are fire sterile."
‘With sprinkler system’ means that the building is fitted throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Appendix E.
Very large (with a top storey more than 18m above ground level or with a 10m deep basement) or unusual dwellinghouses are outside the scope of the guidance provided with regard to dwellinghouses.
"A minimum of 30 minutes in the case of three storey dwellinghouses, increased to 60 minutes minimum for compartment walls separating buildings."
"Buildings within the ‘office’, ‘shop and commercial’, ‘assembly and recreation’, ‘industrial’ and ‘storage and other non-residential’ (except car parks for light vehicles) purpose groups (purpose groups 3 to 7(a)) require sprinklers where there is a top storey more than 30m above ground level."
"The car park should comply with the relevant provisions in the guidance on requirement B3, Section 11."
"For the purposes of meeting the Building Regulations, the following types of steel elements are deemed to have satisfied the minimum period of fire resistance of 15 minutes when tested to the European test method."

"Wind bracing and struts, maximum Hp/A=210m-1 operating under full design load."
Guidance is also available in BS EN 1993-1-2.
The following guidance should be used when applying the fire resistance standards in Table B4.
"If one element of structure supports or carries or gives stability to another, the fire resistance of the supporting element should be no less than the minimum period of fire resistance for the other element (whether that other element is loadbearing or not)."
"In some circumstances, it may be reasonable to vary this principle, for example:"
if a plant room on the roof needs greater fire resistance than the elements of structure that support it.
"If an element of structure forms part of more than one building or compartment, that element should be constructed to the standard of the higher of the relevant provisions."
"If, due to the slope of the ground, one side of a basement is open at ground level (allowing smoke to vent and providing access for firefighting) for elements of structure in that storey it may be appropriate to adopt the standard of fire resistance that applies to above-ground structures."
"d. Although most elements of structure in a single storey building may not need fire resistance, fire resistance is needed if one of the following applies to the element."
"It is part of, or supports, an external wall, and there is provision in the guidance on requirement B4 to limit the extent of openings and other unprotected areas in the wall."
"It is part of, or supports, a compartment wall, including a wall that is common to two or more buildings."
It supports a gallery.
"For the purposes of this paragraph, the ground storey of a building that has one or more basement storeys and no upper storeys may be considered as a single storey building."
The fire resistance of the basement storeys should be that specified for basements.

Further guidance can be found in A Guide to Best Practice in the Specification and Use of Fire-resistant Glazed Systems published by the Glass and Glazing Federation.
"If the protected stairway is also a protected shaft or a firefighting stair (see Section 17), there may be further restrictions on the use of glazed elements."
Measured vertically from the landing floor level or the stair pitch line.
The 100mm limit is intended to reduce the risk of fire spreading from a floor covering.
"All fire doorsets should have the performance shown in Table C1, based on one of the following."
"Fire resistance in terms of integrity, for a period of minutes, when tested to BS 476-22, e.g. FD 30."
A suffix (S) is added for doorsets where restricted smoke leakage at ambient temperatures is needed.
"As determined with reference to Commission Decision 2000/367/EC regarding the classification of the resistance to fire performance of construction products, construction works and parts thereof."
"All fire doorsets should be classified in accordance with BS EN 13501-2, tested to the relevant European method from the following."
As determined with reference to European Parliament and Council Directive 95/16/EC (which applies to lifts that permanently serve buildings and constructions and specified safety components) on the approximation of laws of Member States relating to lifts (‘Lifts Directive’) implementing the Lifts Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/831) and calling upon the harmonised standard BS EN 81-58.
The performance requirement is in terms of integrity (E) for a period of minutes.
An additional classification of Sa is used for all doors where restricted smoke leakage at ambient temperatures is needed.
The requirement is for test exposure from each side of the doorset separately.
"The exception is lift doors, which are tested from the landing side only."
Any test evidence used to verify the fire resistance rating of a doorset or shutter should be checked to ensure both of the following.
It adequately demonstrates compliance.
It is applicable to the complete installed assembly.
Small differences in detail may significantly affect the rating.
"Until relevant harmonised product standards are published, for the purposes of meeting the Building Regulations, products tested in accordance with BS EN 1634-1 (with or without pre-fire test mechanical conditioning) that achieve the minimum performance in Table C1 will be deemed to satisfy the provisions."
"All fire doorsets, including to flat entrances and between a dwellinghouse and an integral garage, should be fitted with a self-closing device, except for all of the following."
Fire doorsets to cupboards.
Fire doorsets to service ducts normally locked shut.
Fire doorsets within flats and dwellinghouses.
"If a self-closing device would be considered to interfere with the normal approved use of the building, self-closing fire doors may be held open by one of the following."
"A fusible link, but not if the doorset is in an opening provided as a means of escape unless it complies with paragraph C7."
An automatic release mechanism activated by an automatic fire detection and alarm system.
A door closer delay device.
"Two fire doorsets may be fitted in the same opening if each door is capable of closing the opening, so the total fire resistance is the sum of their individual resistances."
"If the opening is provided as a means of escape, both fire doorsets should be self-closing."
"If one fire doorset is capable of being easily opened by hand and has a minimum of 30 minutes’ fire resistance, the other fire doorset should comply with both of the following."
Be fitted with an automatic self-closing device.
Be held open by a fusible link.
Fire doorsets often do not provide any significant insulation.
"Unless providing both integrity and insulation in accordance with Appendix B, Table B3, a maximum of 25% of the length of a compartment wall should consist of door openings."
"Where it is practicable to maintain a clear space on both sides of the doorway, the above percentage may be greater."
Rolling shutters should be capable of manual opening and closing for firefighting purposes (see Section 17).
"Rolling shutters across a means of escape should only be released by a heat sensor, such as a fusible link or electric heat detector, in the immediate vicinity of the door."
"Unless a shutter is also intended to partially descend as part of a boundary to a smoke reservoir, shutters across a means of escape should not be closed by smoke detectors or a fire alarm system."
"Unless shown to be satisfactory when tested as part of a fire doorset assembly, the essential components of any hinge on which a fire door is hung should be made entirely from materials that have a minimum melting point of 800°C."
"Except for doorsets listed in paragraph C12, all fire doorsets should be marked with one of the following fire safety signs, complying with BS 5499-5, as appropriate."
To be kept closed when not in use – mark ‘Fire door keep shut’.
To be kept locked when not in use – mark ‘Fire door keep locked shut’.
Held open by an automatic release mechanism or free swing device – mark ‘Automatic fire door keep clear’.
"All fire doorsets should be marked on both sides, except fire doorsets to cupboards and service ducts, which should be marked on the outside."
The following fire doorsets are not required to comply with paragraph C11.
Doors to and within flats and dwellinghouses.
Bedroom doors in ‘residential (other)’ (purpose group 2(b)) premises.
Lift entrance/landing doors.
The performance of some doorsets set out in Table C1 is linked to the minimum periods of fire resistance for elements of structure given in Tables B3 and B4.
Limitations on the use of uninsulated glazing in fire doorsets are given in Table B5.
"Recommendations for the specification, design, construction, installation and maintenance of fire doorsets constructed with non-metallic door leaves are given in BS 8214."
"Guidance on timber fire resisting doorsets, in relation to the new European test standard, may be found in Timber Fire Resisting Doorsets: Maintaining Performance Under the New European Test Standard published by the Timber Research and Development Association (TRADA)."
Guidance for metal doors is given in Code of Practice for Fire Resisting Metal Doorsets published by the Door and Shutter Manufacturers’ Association (DSMA).
Hardware used on fire doors can significantly affect their performance in a fire.

"Where appropriate, the data should reflect the average occupant density at a peak trading time of year."
"Where accommodation is not directly covered by the descriptions given, a reasonable value based on a similar use may be selected."
"Where any part of the building is to be used for more than one type of accommodation, the most onerous factor(s) should be applied."
"Where the building contains different types of accommodation, the occupancy of each different area should be calculated using the relevant space factor."
For detailed guidance on appropriate floor space factors for concourses in sports grounds refer to Concourses published by the Football Licensing Authority.
"Alternatively the occupant number may be taken as the number of fixed seats provided, if the occupants will normally be seated."
"Shops excluding those under item 10, but including: supermarkets and department stores (main sales areas), shops for personal services, such as hairdressing, and shops for the delivery or collection of goods for cleaning, repair or other treatment or for members of the public themselves carrying out such cleaning, repair or other treatment."
"Shops (excluding those in covered shopping complexes but including department stores) trading predominantly in furniture, floor coverings, cycles, prams, large domestic appliances or other bulky goods, or trading on a wholesale self-selection basis (cash and carry)."
Travel distance is measured as the shortest route.
Both of the following should be observed.
"If there is fixed seating or other fixed obstructions, the shortest route is along the centre line of the seatways and gangways."
"If the route includes a stair, the shortest route is along the pitch line on the centre line of travel."
Width is measured according to the following.
"For a door (or doorway), the clear width when the door is open (Diagram D1)."
"For an escape route, either of the following."
When the route is defined by walls: the width at 1500mm above finished floor level.
Elsewhere: the minimum width of passage available between any fixed obstructions.
"For a stair, the clear width between the walls or balustrades."
"On escape routes and stairs, handrails and strings intruding into the width by a maximum of 100mm on each side may be ignored."
"Rails used for guiding a stair-lift may be ignored, but it should be possible to park the lift’s chair or carriage in a position that does not obstruct the stair or landing."
In every case measure the volume contained by all of the following.
Under surface of roof.
"When there is not an outer enclosing wall, measure to the outermost edge of the floor slab."
The measured volume should include internal walls and partitions.
"If a hipped roof, measure to outermost point of roof at base area"
"If a lean-to roof, measure from the face of wall to the outermost point of roof"
"Room, garage, conservatory or outbuilding,"
"Storey, part or compartment,"
"To count the number of storeys in a building,"
"To count the number of storeys in a building, or in a separated part of a building, count only at the position which gives the greatest number and exclude any basement storeys."
"In assembly buildings (purpose group 5), a gallery is included as a storey, but not if it is a loading gallery, fly gallery, stage grid, lighting bridge, or any gallery provided for similar purposes, or for maintenance and repair."
"In other purpose group buildings, galleries are not counted as a storey."
Height of top from storey measured from upper floor surface of top floor to ground level on lowest side of building
The free area of a smoke ventilator should be measured by either of the following.
The declared aerodynamic free area in accordance with BS EN 12101-2.
"The total unobstructed cross-sectional area (geometric free area), measured in the plane where the area is at a minimum and at right angles to the direction of air flow (Diagram D7)."
Sprinkler systems E1 Sprinkler systems installed in buildings can reduce the risk to life and significantly reduce the degree of damage caused by fire within a building.
Further recommendations for the provision of sprinklers are provided in the following sections:
"Design of sprinkler systems E3 Where required, sprinkler systems should be provided throughout the building or separated part, unless acting as a compensatory feature to address a specific risk."
They should be designed and installed in accordance with the following.
"For residential buildings, the requirements of BS 9251."
"For non-residential buildings, or residential buildings outside the scope of BS 9251, the requirements of BS EN 12845, including the relevant hazard classification together with additional measures to improve system reliability and availability as described in Annex F of the standard."
Any sprinkler system installed to satisfy the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations should be provided with additional measures to improve system reliability and availability and is therefore to be regarded as a life safety system.
"However, there may be some circumstances in which additional measures to improve system reliability and availability specified in Annex F of BS EN 12845 are inappropriate or unnecessary."
"If the provisions in a building vary from those in this document, sprinkler protection can also sometimes be used as a compensatory feature."
BS 9251 makes additional recommendations when sprinklers are proposed as compensatory features.
"For non-residential sprinkler systems designed and installed to BS EN 12845, water supplies should consist of either of the following."
"Two single water supplies complying with clause 9.6.1, independent of each other."
Two stored water supplies meeting all of the following conditions.
"Gravity or suction tanks should satisfy all the requirements of clause 9.6.2(b), other than capacity."
Any pump arrangements should comply with clause 10.2.
"In addition to meeting the requirements for inflow, either of the following should apply."
" The capacity of each tank should be at least half the specified minimum water volume of a single full capacity tank, appropriate to the hazard."
" One tank should be at least equivalent to half the specified water volume of a single full capacity tank, and the other shall not be less than the minimum volume of a reduced capacity tank (see clause 9.3.4) appropriate to the hazard."
"The total capacity of the water supply in (iii), including any inflow for a reduced capacity tank, should be at least that of a single full holding capacity tank that complies with Table 9, Table 10 or clause 9.3.2.3, as appropriate to the hazard and pipework design."
"For the systems described in paragraph E5, both of the following apply if pumps are used to draw water from two tanks."
Each pump should be able to draw water from either tank.
"Any one pump, or either tank, should be able to be isolated."
The sprinkler water supplies should not be used as connections for other services or other fixed firefighting systems.
Alternatively access to the British and European Standards may be gained at public reference libraries.

Paragraphs H2 and J7 are excluded from Regulation 8 because they deal directly with prevention of the contamination of water.
"Parts E and M (which deal, respectively, with resistance to the passage of sound, and access to and use of buildings) are excluded from Regulation 8 because they address the welfare and convenience of building users."
Part L is excluded from Regulation 8 because it addresses the conservation of fuel and power.
"All these matters are amongst the purposes, other than health and safety, that may be addressed by Building Regulations."
Any building work which is subject to the requirements imposed by Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations shall be carried out in accordance with regulation 7. Guidance on meeting these requirements on materials and workmanship is contained in Approved Document 7.
"Building Regulations are made for specific purposes, primarily the health and safety, welfare and convenience of people and for energy conservation."
Standards and other technical specifications may provide relevant guidance to the extent that they relate to these considerations.
"However, they may also address other aspects of performance or matters which, although they relate to health and safety etc., are not covered by the Building Regulations."
"When an Approved Document makes reference to a named standard, the relevant version of the standard to which it refers is the one listed at the end of the publication."
"However, if this version has been revised or updated by the issuing standards body, the new version may be used as a source of guidance provided it continues to address the relevant requirements of the Regulations."
This document is one of a series that has been approved by the First Secretary of State for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of Schedule 1 to and Regulation 7 of the Building Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/2214) for England and Wales.
At the back of this document is a list of all the documents that have been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for this purpose.
Approved Documents are intended to provide guidance for some of the more common building situations.
"However, there may well be alternative ways of achieving compliance with the requirements."
Thus there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an Approved Document if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way.
The guidance contained in an Approved Document relates only to the particular requirements of the Regulations which the document addresses.
The building work will also have to comply with the Requirements of any other relevant paragraphs in Schedule 1 to the Regulations.
There are Approved Documents which give guidance on each of the Parts of Schedule 1 and on Regulation 7.
"In accordance with Regulation 8, the requirements in Part C of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations do not require anything to be done except for the purpose of securing reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about buildings (and any others who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings)."
"The requirements in Part C address health and safety, and do not seek to protect the building fabric for its own sake."
Thus the degree of precautions needed to comply with Part C will be influenced by the intended use of the building.
Part C may not apply where it can be demonstrated that it will not serve to increase the protection to the health and safety of any persons habitually employed in the building in question.
"Health and safety regulations such as the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 may impose requirements on employers and those in control of buildings used as workplaces in relation to certain physical characteristics of the workplace."
There are also requirements in health and safety law which affect building design.
"In particular, Regulation 11 of the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 places duties on designers including the need to take account of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 which relate to the design of, and materials used in, any structure intended for use as a workplace."
"Where such regulations apply there may be confusion as to whether the Building Regulations or health and safety requirements take precedence, as both will apply."
Where an inspector for the purposes of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 has identified a contravention of such health and safety regulations they may seek to serve an improvement notice to secure compliance.
"In such circumstances the inspector is prevented by virtue of Section 23(3) of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 from requiring measures which are more onerous than necessary to comply with any requirements of the Building Regulations, unless the specific requirement of health and safety regulations are themselves more onerous."
This Approved Document deals with the following Requirements which are contained in the Building Regulations 2010.
Preparation of site and resistance to contaminants.
"The ground to be covered by the building shall be reasonably free from any material that might damage the building or affect its stability, including vegetable matter, topsoil and pre-existing foundations."
"Reasonable precautions shall be taken to avoid danger to health and safety caused by contaminants on or in the ground covered, or to be covered by the building and any land associated with the building."
Adequate sub-soil drainage shall be provided if it is needed to avoid:
the passage of ground moisture to the interior of the building;
"damage to the building, including damage through the transport of water-borne contaminants to the foundations of the building."
"For the purpose of this requirement, ‘contaminant’ means any substance which is or may become harmful to persons or buildings including substances which are corrosive, explosive, flammable, radioactive or toxic."
"The walls, floors and roof of the building shall adequately protect the building and people who use the building from harmful effects caused by:"
precipitation including wind-driven spray;
interstitial and surface condensation; and
spillage of water from or associated with sanitary fittings or fixed appliances.
"Requirement C1 (2), which addresses resistance to contaminants, is now added to the requirements in Regulation 6 of the Building Regulations 2010 which should be complied with when there are certain material changes of use of buildings."
Regulation 6 sets out which parts of Schedule 1 should be complied with when there is a material change of use of the building as defined in Regulation 5.
The absence of such a requirement would have meant that occupiers of buildings in areas at risk from contaminants may remain unprotected after the building work to effect the change of use is complete.
"In particular, some contaminants can penetrate the floors of buildings such as landfill gas arising from the deposition of waste and vapours from spills of organic solvents and fuel."
These contaminants can also migrate laterally from land outside the building.
"In order to deal with this Requirement C1 (2) now applies to all changes of use that have a residential purpose or provide sleeping accommodation including hotels, i.e. as defined by Regulation 5 (a) to 5 (g) with the exception of 5 (e) public buildings and 5 (j) shops."
"Other types of buildings are covered by Health and Safety legislation so do not need addressing through the Building Regulations, for example workplace assessment, including radon measurements."
Attention is drawn to the following extracts from the Building Regulations 2010.
"‘Room for residential purposes’ means a room, or suite of rooms, which is not a dwelling-house or a flat and which is used by one or more persons to live and sleep and includes a room in a hostel, a hotel, a boarding house, a hall of residence or a residential home, but does not include a a room in a hospital, or other similar establishment, used for patient accommodation."
"For the purposes of paragraph 8 (1)(e) of Schedule 1 to the Act and for the purposes of these Regulations, there is a material change of use where there is a change in the purposes for which or the circumstances in which a building is used, so that after the change:"
"the building is used as a dwelling, where previously it was not;"
"the building contains a flat, where previously it did not;"
"the building is used as a hotel or boarding house, where previously it was not;"
"the building is used as an institution, where previously it was not;"
"the building is used as a public building, where previously it was not;"
"the building is not a building described in Classes 1 to 6 in Schedule 2, where previously it was;"
"the building, which contains at least one dwelling, contains a greater or lesser number of dwellings than it did previously;"
"the building contains a room for residential purposes, where previously it did not;"
"the building, which contains at least one room for residential purposes, contains a greater or lesser number of such rooms than it did previously; or"
"the building is used as a shop, where previously it was not."
"Where there is a material change of use of the whole of a building, such work, if any, shall be carried out as is necessary to ensure that the building complies with the applicable requirements of the following paragraphs of Schedule 1:"
"in all cases,"
(conservation of fuel and power – dwellings);
"in the case of a material change of use described in Regulations 5(c), (d), (e) or (f), A1 to A3 (structure);"
Material change of use or alterations to existing buildings may include work on historic buildings.
Historic buildings include:
buildings situated in conservation areas;
buildings which are of architectural and historical interest and which are referred to as a material consideration in a local authority’s development plan;
"buildings of architectural and historical interest within national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and world heritage sites."
The need to conserve the special characteristics of such historic buildings needs to be recognised3.
"In such work, the aim should be to improve resistance to contaminants and moisture where it is practically possible, always provided that the work does not prejudice the character of the historic building, or increase the risk of long-term deterioration to the building fabric or fittings."
In arriving at an appropriate balance between historic building conservation and improving resistance to contaminants and moisture it would be appropriate to take into account the advice of the local planning authority’s conservation officer.
Particular issues relating to work in historic buildings that warrant sympathetic treatment and where advice from others could therefore be beneficial include the following:
avoiding excessively intrusive gas protective measures;
ensuring that moisture ingress to the roof structure is limited and the roof can breathe.
Where it is not possible to provide dedicated ventilation to pitched roofs it is important to seal existing service penetrations in the ceiling and to provide draught proofing to any loft hatches.
Any new loft insulation should be kept sufficiently clear of the eaves so that any adventitious ventilation is not reduced.
"in the case of a building exceeding fifteen metres in height, B4 (1) (external fire spread – walls);"
"in the case of a material change of use described in regulation 5(a), (b), (c), (d), (g), (h), (i) or, where the material charge provides new residential accommodation, (f), C1 (2) (resistance to contaminents);"
"in the case of material change of use described in regulation 5(a), C2 (resistance to moisture);"
"in the case of a material change of use described in regulation 5(a), (b), (c), (g), (h) or (i), E1 to E3 (resistance to the passage of sound);"
"in the case of a material change of use described in regulation 5(e), where the public building consists or contains a school, E4 (acoustic conditions in schools);"
"in the case of a material change of use described in Regulation 5(a) or (b), G2 (water efficiency) and G3(4) (hot water supply and systems: hot water supply to fixed baths);"
"in the case of a material change of use described in regulation 5(c), (d), (e) or (j), M1 (access and use)."
"Where there is a material change of use of 2. part only of a building, such work, if any, shall be carried out as is necessary to ensure that:"
that part complies in all cases with any applicable requirement referred to in paragraph (1) (a);
"in a case to which sub-paragraphs (b), (e), (f), (g) or (h) of paragraph (1) apply, that part complies with the requirements referred to in the relevant sub-paragraph; and"
"in the case to which sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph (1) applies, the whole building complies with the requirement referred to in that sub-paragraph; and"
in the case to which sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (1) applies:
that part and any sanitary appliances provided in or in connection with that part comply with the requirements referred to in that sub-paragraph; and
the building complies with requirement M1 (a) of Schedule 1 to the extent that reasonable provision is made to provide either suitable independent access to that part or suitable access through the building to that part.
BS 7913:1998 Guide to the principles of the conservation of historic buildings.
Provides guidance on the principles that should be applied when proposing work on historic buildings.
"SPAB Information Sheet 4 The need for old buildings to ‘breathe’, 1986."
"In most cases the rate at which gas seeps into buildings, mainly through floors, can be reduced by edge located sumps or sub-floor vents."
These are less intrusive than internal sumps or ducts that may involve taking up floors.
If flagged floors are taken up the stones should be indexed and their layout recorded to facilitate relaying when work is completed.
Radon can be dispersed by ventilation strategies such as positive pressurisation.
These systems can often be accommodated in an unobtrusive manner.
"If internal mechanical ventilation is used to disperse ground gases, it may affect the functioning of combustion appliances and may lead to the spillage of products of combustion into the building."
Guidance on this can be found in BRE Report BR 21175.
"BRE Report BR 211 Radon: Guidance on protective measures for new buildings (including supplementary advice for extensions, conversions and refurbishment), 2007."
"In the First Secretary of State’s view the requirements of C1 will be met by making reasonable provisions to secure the health and safety of persons in and about the building, and by safeguarding them and buildings against adverse effects of:"
"unsuitable material including vegetable matter, topsoil and pre-existing foundations;"
"contaminants on or in the ground covered, or to be covered, by the building and any land associated with the building; and"
"In the First Secretary of State’s view the requirements of C2 will be met if the floors, walls and roof are constructed to protect the building and secure the health and safety of persons in and about the building from harmful effects caused by:"
moisture emanating from the ground or from groundwater;
precipitation and wind-driven spray;
interstitial and surface condensation; and
spillage of water from or associated with sanitary fittings and fixed appliances.
"Requirement C1 and deal with site preparation and resistance to contaminants under the headings ‘Clearance or treatment of unsuitable material’, ‘Resistance to contaminants’ and ‘Subsoil drainage’."
"Building Regulations are made for the purposes of securing the health, safety, welfare and convenience of persons in and about buildings."
This means that action may need to be taken to mitigate the effects of contaminants within the land associated with the building as well as protecting the building and persons in and about the building.
"This includes action designed to prevent, i.e. inhibit, the ingress of radon gas into buildings to protect the health of occupants from exposure to indoor radon."
Hazards associated with the ground may include the effects of vegetable matter including tree roots.
"They may include health hazards associated with chemical and biological contaminants, and gas generation from biodegradation of organic matter."
"Hazards to the built environment can be physical, chemical or biological."
Items such as underground storage tanks or foundations may create hazards to both health and the building.
Physical hazards also include unstable fill or unsuitable hardcore containing sulphate.
"In addition, the naturally occurring 0.5 radioactive gas radon and gases produced by some soils and minerals can be a hazard."
"Sections 4, 5 and 6 of this document 0.6 cover Requirement C2 and deal with resistance to moisture under the headings ‘Floors’, ‘Walls’ and ‘Roofs’."
"Moisture can rise from the ground to damage floors and the base of walls on any site, although much more severe problems can arise in sites that are liable to flooding."
"Driving rain or wind- driven spray from the sea or other water bodies adjacent to the building can penetrate walls or roofs directly, or through cracks or joints between elements, and damage the structure or internal fittings or equipment."
Surface condensation from the water vapour generated within the building can cause moulds to grow which pose a health hazard to occupants.
Interstitial condensation may cause damage to the structure.
"Spills and leaks of water, in rooms where sanitary fittings or fixed appliances that use water are installed (e.g. bathrooms and kitchens), may cause damage to floor decking or other parts of the structure."
The diagrams in this Approved Document 0.7 have been set out to show typical situations and relationships between adjacent elements of construction.
Conventional notations and hatching have been used to identify different materials.
"However, the diagrams cannot show specific situations."
It remains the responsibility of the designer and builder to ensure that the building work meets all relevant aspects of the Building Regulations.
"Policies set out in the National Planning 0.8 Policy Framework7 aim to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding, including requiring new development to be flood resilient and resistant, as and where appropriate."
Flood resistance is not currently a requirement in Schedule 1 of the Building Regulations 2010 (and amendments).
"However, when local considerations necessitate building in flood prone areas the buildings can be constructed to mitigate some effects of flooding such as:"
elevated groundwater levels or flow of subsoil water across the site – this can be alleviated by the provision of adequate sub-soil drainage (see Section 3);
"sewer flooding due to backflow or surcharging of sewers or drains – this can be addressed through the use of non-return valves and anti-flooding devices (see Section 3, paragraph 3.6);"
"National Planning Policy Framework, Communities and Local Government, March 2012."
"intrusion of groundwater through floors – this can be addressed through the use of water resistant construction (see Section 4, paragraphs 4.7 to 4.12);"
"entry of water into floor voids – provision to inspect and clear out sub-floor voids can be considered (see Section 4, paragraph 4.20)."
Further information on flood resistant and resilient construction can be found in the publication Improving the flood performance of new buildings – Flood resilient construction8.
The guidance given on resistance to 0.9 contaminants in Section 2 is for the purposes of the Building Regulations and their associated requirements.
Users of this document should be aware that there may be further provisions for dealing with contaminants contained in planning guidance or legislation made under the regime set out in Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which may be supplementary to the requirements of the Building Regulations.
"The Contaminated Land (England) Regulations 2006 (as amended 2012) make detailed provisions of a procedural nature to help give full effect to the Part IIA regime, and the statutory guidance161 provides a basis for enforcing authorities to apply the regime."
"Where contaminants are removed, treated or contained as part of the construction works, waste management law may apply."
"If waste is removed for off-site disposal, the ‘Duty of Care’ and/or special waste requirements11 will apply."
Redevelopment is often the most effective means of remediating land affected by contaminants.
"This process is subject to controls under the Town and Country Planning Acts, and local planning authorities follow the guidance in the National Planning Policy Framework7."
"Although environmental protection, planning and Building Regulations have different purposes their aims are similar."
Consequently the processes for assessing the effects of pollutants and contaminants are similar.
An investigation or assessment to determine the characteristics of a site can be further developed for Building Regulations purposes when the form and construction of the buildings are known.
If appropriate data are gathered at the early stages it should not be necessary to completely re-evaluate a site for Building Regulations purposes.
Other regulatory authorities may have an interest in land affected by contamination.
"It may be necessary at any stage of the site investigation, risk assessment or remediation process to notify any unexpected events or change in outcomes to these regulatory authorities."
The most likely situations are:
"The Environmental Health department of the district council should be informed if contaminants are found on a site where the presence of contamination has not been formally recognised through the planning process, if it is found that contaminants from the site are affecting other land or if contaminants are reaching the site from neighbouring land."
Additional discussions may also be required if the contamination identified differs from that which has been previously discussed and agreed with the local planning authority (LPA) or Environmental Health department.
"As redevelopment is the most favoured means of dealing with land affected by contaminants, all land quality issues should be set out in documents in support of planning approval sent to the local planning authority."
As designs are refined it may be necessary to inform the LPA of any impacts the design changes may have on the risk assessment and remediation strategy.
The Environment Agency has a number of relevant duties at sites where contamination may be an issue; in particular these include specific duties relating to waste management and the protection of water quality and resources.
"Sites may be of concern to the Environment Agency where there is a significant potential impact on controlled waters, if the site is designated as a Special Site under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, where an authorisation may be required or specific hazards are found."
The local Environment Agency office should be contacted to identify if there are any relevant issues.
Some remedial measures may themselves require prior authorisation from the Environment Agency including abstraction licensing for groundwater treatment and waste management licensing for a number of activities involving contaminated soils.

"Environmental Protection Act 1990: Part 2A: Contaminated Land Statutory Guidance, Defra, 2012 (www.defra.gov.uk)."
The risks should be assessed and the working procedures should be in accordance with the requirements of the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007.
It may be necessary to give notice to the Health and Safety Executive prior to work starting.
The following meanings apply to terms throughout this Approved Document:
Building and land associated with the building.
The building and all the land forming the site subject to building operations which includes land under the building and the land around it which may have an effect on the building or its users (see also paragraph 2.11).
"Any substance13 which is or may become harmful to persons or buildings, including substances which are corrosive, explosive, flammable, radioactive or toxic."
Lower horizontal surface of any space in a building including finishes that are laid as part of the permanent construction.
"Water in liquid form, either as a static water table or flowing through the ground."
"Deposition of liquid water from a vapour, occurring within or between the layers of the building envelope."
"Water in liquid, solid or gaseous form."
"Moisture in any form falling from the atmosphere, usually as rain, sleet, snow or hail."
Any part of the external envelope of a building that is at an angle of less than 70° to the horizontal.
Water droplets driven by the wind from the surface of the sea or other bodies of water adjacent to buildings.
Sea spray can be especially hazardous to materials because of its salt content.
"Deposition of liquid water from a vapour, occurring on visible surfaces within the building."
Vapour control layer.
"Material of construction, usually a membrane, that substantially reduces the water vapour transfer through any building in which it is incorporated."
Any opaque part of the external envelope of a building that is at an angle of 70° or more to the horizontal.
The preparation of the site will depend on the findings of the site investigation.
"The site investigation is relevant to Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this Approved Document and also to the requirements of Approved Document A with respect to foundations."
The site investigation should consist of a number of well-defined stages:
"Clear objectives should be set for the investigation, including the scope and requirements, which enable the investigation to be planned and carried out efficiently and provide the required information; b. Desk study."
"A review of the historical, geological and environmental information about the site is essential;"
Site reconnaissance or walkover survey.
This stage of the investigation facilitates the identification of actual and potential physical hazards and the design of the main investigation;
Main investigation and reporting.
This will usually include intrusive and non-intrusive sampling and testing to provide soil parameters for design and construction.
The main investigation should be preceded by (b) and (c) above.
The extent and level of investigation need 1.2 to be tailored to the type of development and the previous use of land.
"Typically the site investigation should include susceptibility to groundwater levels and flow, underlying geology, and ground and hydro-geological properties."
"A geotechnical site investigation should identify physical hazards for site development, determine an appropriate design and provide soil parameters for design and construction."
BS EN 1997-2:2007: Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design with its UK National Annex14 supported by BS 5930:1999+A2:201036 provide comprehensive guidance on site investigation.
"Guidance on site investigation for low-rise buildings is given in six BRE Digests covering procurement15, desk studies16, the walk-over survey17, trial pits18, soil description19 and direct investigation20."
Reference should also be made to BS 8103-1:201121.
"Where the site is potentially affected by contaminants, a combined geotechnical and geo-environmental investigation should be considered."
Guidance on assessing and remediating sites affected by contaminants is given in Section 2: Resistance to contaminants.
Vegetable matter such as turf and roots should be removed from the ground to be covered by the building at least to a depth to prevent later growth.
The effects of roots close to the building also need to be assessed.
Consideration should be given to whether this provision need apply to a building used wholly for:
"storing goods, provided that any persons who are habitually employed in the building are engaged only in taking in, caring for or taking out the goods; or"
a purpose such that the provision would not serve to increase protection to the health or safety of any persons habitually employed in the building.
"Where mature trees are present on sites with shrinkable clays (see Diagram 1 and Table 1), the potential damage arising from ground heave to services and floor slabs and oversite concrete should be assessed."
Reference should be made to BRE Digest 29822.
"Where soils and vegetation type would require significant quantities of soil to be removed, reference should be made to BRE Digests 24023 and 24124, and to the FBE (Foundation for the Built Environment) report25."
The effects of remaining trees on services and building movements close to the building need to be assessed using guidance in NHBC (National House Building Council) Standards Chapter 4.226.

Building services such as below ground drainage should be sufficiently robust or flexible to accommodate the presence of any tree roots.
Joints should be made so that roots will not penetrate them.
"Where roots could pose a hazard to building services, consideration should be given to their removal."
"On sites previously used for buildings, consideration should be given to the presence of existing foundations, services, buried tanks and any other infrastructure that could endanger persons in and about the building and any land associated with the building."
"Where the site contains fill or made ground, consideration should be given to its compressibility and its potential for collapse on wetting, and to appropriate remedial measures to prevent damaging differential settlement."

"contaminants can arise on sites, especially those that have had a previous industrial use (see paragraph 0.12 for the definition of a contaminant)."
"In particular, the burial of biodegradable waste in landfills can give rise to landfill gas (see paragraph 2.25)."
"Sites with a generally rural use such as agriculture or forestry may be contaminated by pesticides, fertiliser, fuel and oils and decaying matter of biological origin."
Table 2 lists examples of sites that are 2.2 likely to contain contaminants.
"It is derived from the ‘Industry Profile’ guides produced by the former Department of the Environment (DoE), each of which deals with a different industry with the potential to cause contamination29."
"Each profile identifies contaminants which may be associated with the industry, areas on the site in which they may be found and possible routes for migration."
"In addition, there can be problems of 2.3 natural contaminants in certain parts of the country as a result of the underlying geology."
"In this instance the contaminants can be naturally occurring heavy metals (e.g. cadmium and arsenic) originating in mining areas, and gases (e.g. methane and carbon dioxide) originating in coal mining areas and from organic rich soils and sediments such as peat and river silts."
"The Environment Agency has produced two guidance documents31,32 on this subject which discuss the geographical extent of these contaminants, the associated hazards, methods of site investigation and protective measures."
"Natural contaminants also include the radioactive gas radon, although the specific approach for assessing and managing the risks it poses is different from other contaminants (see paragraphs 2.39 and 2.40)."
Sulphate attack affecting concrete floor 2.5 slabs and oversite concrete associated with particular strata also needs to be considered.
Principal areas of sulphate bearing strata in England and Wales are shown in Diagram 1 and Table 1.

Diagram 2 Example of a conceptual model for a site showing source–pathway– receptor
To ensure safe development of land 2.6 affected by contaminants the principles of risk assessment (as set out in paragraph 2.8 below) should be followed.
"The general approach is founded on the concept of the ‘source–pathway–receptor’ relationship, or pollutant linkage, where source refers to contaminants in or on the ground."
This is illustrated by the conceptual model34 in Diagram 2.
"When land affected by contaminants is developed, receptors (i.e. buildings, building materials and building services, as well as people) are introduced onto the site and so it is necessary to break the pollutant linkages or condition them so that they do not pose a significant risk."
"This can be achieved by: a. treating the contaminant (e.g. use of physical, chemical or biological processes to eliminate or reduce the contaminant’s toxicity or harmful properties);"
blocking or removing the pathway (e.g. isolating the contaminant beneath protective layers or installing barriers to prevent migration);
"protecting or removing the receptor (e.g. changing the form or layout of the development, using appropriately designed building materials, etc.);"
removing the contaminant (e.g. excavating contaminated material).
"The conceptual model is a textual or schematic hypothesis of the nature and sources of contamination, the pollution migration pathways and potential receptors, developed on the basis of the information from a preliminary assessment, and is refined during subsequent phases of investigation."
Code of practice for In assessing the risks for land contamination 2.8 a tiered approach is adopted with an increasing level of detail required in progressing through the tiers.
"The three tiers are: preliminary risk assessment, generic quantitative risk assessment (GQRA) and detailed quantitative risk assessment (DQRA)."
"Once the need for a risk assessment has been identified, it will always be necessary to undertake a preliminary risk assessment but, depending on the situation and the outcome, it may not be appropriate to do a more detailed risk assessment."
"Alternatively, it may be necessary to do only one or both of the more detailed risk assessments."
"For each tier, the model procedures for the management of land contamination (CLR 1143) describes the stages of risk assessment that should be followed for identifying risks and making judgements about the consequences of land affected by contamination when developing a site."
These are outlined below:
"Hazard identification – developing the conceptual model by establishing contaminant sources, pathways and receptors."
This is the preliminary site assessment which consists of a desk study and a site walk-over in order to obtain sufficient information to obtain an initial understanding of the potential risks.
An initial conceptual model for the site can be based on this information.
Hazard assessment – identifying what pollutant linkages may be present and analysing the potential for unacceptable risks.
Collect further information and undertake exploratory site investigation to refine understanding of risks and the likelihood of pollutant linkages.
The results may be interpreted using generic criteria and assumptions.
Risk estimation – establishing the scale of the possible consequences by considering the degree of harm that may result and to which receptors.
Undertake detailed ground investigation to collect sufficient data to estimate the risks the contaminants may pose to defined receptors under defined conditions of exposure.
Risk evaluation – deciding whether the risks are acceptable or unacceptable.
"Review all site data to decide whether estimated risks are unacceptable, taking into account the nature and scale of any uncertainties associated with the risk estimation process."
Guidance on the investigation of sites potentially affected by contaminants is provided in:
BS 10175:2011 Code of practice for investigation of potentially contaminated sites37;
"the Environment Agency documents38,41,42,43,44,45."
They recommend a risk based approach to identify and quantify the hazards that may be present and the nature of the risk they may pose.
"They describe the design and execution of field investigations, including suitable sample distribution strategies, sampling and testing."
A preliminary site assessment is required to provide information on the past and present uses of the site and surrounding area that may give rise to contamination (see Table 2).
During the site walk-over there may be signs of possible contaminants (see Table 3).
The information collated from the desk study and site walk-over can assist and will dictate the design of the exploratory and detailed ground investigation.

Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture Approved Document CONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION RESISTANCE TO CONTAMINANTS 2.11 The site assessment and risk evaluation should pay particular attention to the area of the site subject to building operations.
"Those parts of the land associated with the building that include the building itself, gardens and other places on the site that are accessible to users of the building and those in and about the building should be remediated to the requirements of the Building Regulations."
"There may be a case for a lower level of remediation if part of, or the remainder of, the land associated with the building, or adjacent to such land, is accessible to a lesser extent to the user or those in and about the building than the main parts of the buildings and their respective gardens."
This incremental approach may also apply when very large sites are subject to redevelopment in stages; it may be possible to limit remediation to the site that is subject to building operations.
In all cases the risk evaluation and remediation strategy documentation is likely to be appropriate for demonstrating that restricted remediation is acceptable.
The onus is on the applicant to show why part of a site may be excluded from particular remediation measures.
"Even if the adjacent land is not subject to Building Regulations, which are concerned with health and safety, it may still be subject to planning control legislation or to control under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990."
The Planning Authority should be informed prior to any intrusive investigations or if any substance is found which is at variance with any preliminary statements made about the nature of the site.
"The detailed ground investigation must provide sufficient information for the confirmation of a conceptual model for the site, the risk assessment and the design and specification of any remedial works."
"This is likely to involve collection and analysis of soil, soil gas, surface and groundwater samples by the use of invasive and/or non-invasive techniques."
"An investigation of the groundwater regime, levels and flows is essential for most sites since elevated groundwater levels could bring contaminants close to the surface both beneath the building and in any land associated with the building."
Expert advice should be sought.
"During the development of land affected by contaminants the health and safety of both the public and workers should be considered46,47."
If unacceptable risks to the defined 2.15 receptor have been identified then these need to be managed through appropriate remedial measures.
The risk management objectives are defined by the need to break the pollutant linkages using the methods outlined in paragraph 2.7 and described below.
"Other objectives will also need to be considered such as timescale, cost, remedial works, planning constraints and sustainability."
"Depending on the contaminant, three generic types of remedial measures can be considered: treatment, containment and removal."
The containment or treatment of waste may require a waste management licence from the Environment Agency.
"HSE Report HSG 66 Protection of workers and the general public during the development of contaminated land, 1991."
"CIRIA Report 132 A guide to safe working practices for contaminated land, 1993."
"When building work is undertaken on sites affected by contaminants where control measures are already in place, care must be taken not to compromise these measures."
"For example, cover systems may be breached when new building foundations are constructed, such as when extensions are added."
A wide range of treatment processes is now available for dealing with contaminants.
"Biological, chemical and physical techniques carried out either in or ex situ exist which may decrease one or more of the following features of the contaminants: mass, concentration, mobility, flux or toxicity."
The choice of the most appropriate technique for a particular site is a highly site-specific decision for which specialist advice should be sought.
Containment in its widest sense usually means encapsulation of material containing contaminants but in the context of building development containment is often taken to mean cover systems.
"However, in-ground vertical barriers may also be required to control lateral migration of contaminants."
Cover systems involve the placement of one or more layers of materials over the site to achieve one or more of the following objectives:
break the pollutant linkage between receptors and contaminants;
improve geotechnical properties; and
reduce exposure to an acceptable level.
"Some of the building structures, e.g. foundations, sub-structure and ground floor, may, dependent on the circumstances and construction, contribute to measures to provide effective protection of health from contaminants."
Imported fill and soil for cover systems 2.20 should be assessed at source to ensure that it is suitable for use48.
"Design and dimensioning of cover systems, particularly soil based ones typically used for gardens, should take account of their long-term performance where intermixing of the soil cover with the contaminants in the ground can take place."
Maintenance and monitoring may be necessary.
"Gradual intermixing due to natural effects and activities such as burrowing animals, gardening, etc. needs to be considered."
"Excavations by householders for garden features, etc. can penetrate the cover layer and may lead to exposure to contaminants."
"Further guidance on the design, construction and performance of cover layers is given in the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) Report SP12449."
This involves the excavation and safe disposal to licensed landfill of the contaminants and contaminated material.
"Excavation can be targeted to contaminant ‘hot spots’, or it may be necessary to remove sufficient depth of contaminated material to accommodate a cover system within the planned site levels."
Removal may not be viable depending on the extent and depth of the contaminants on the site and the availability of suitably licensed landfills.
Imported fill should be assessed at source to ensure that there are no materials that will pose unacceptable risks to potential receptors.
Further detailed guidance on all three types of remedial measure is given in the Environment Agency/NHBC R & D Publication 66 referred to above and in a series of CIRIA publications50–55.
"The hazards to buildings, building materials and services on sites affected by contaminants need to be considered since these are also receptors."
The hazards to consider are:
"These include inorganic and organic acids, alkalis, organic solvents and inorganic chemicals such as sulphates and chlorides which may affect the long-term durability of construction materials (such as concrete, metals and plastics)."
"soaked ground, etc. which, if ignited, may lead to subterranean fires and consequent damage to the structural stability of buildings, and the integrity or performance of services."
The two main types are blast furnace and steel making slag which may expand some time after deposition – usually when water is introduced onto the site – causing damage to buildings and services.

"This contaminated water may affect building elements, such as walls or ground floors, that are close to or in the ground."
Guidance on flood resilient construction can be found in Improving the flood performance of new buildings – Flood resilient construction8.
"Although the building and building materials are the main receptors with these hazards, ultimately there could be harm to health."
A particular concern is the effect of hydrocarbons permeating potable water pipes made of polyethylene.
Guidance on reducing these risks is given in a Water Research Centre report58.
Further guidance on the assessment and management of risks to building materials is given in an Environment Agency document59.
The term ‘methane and other gases’ is used to define hazardous soil gases which either originate from waste deposited in landfill sites or are generated naturally.
It does not include radon which is dealt with separately in paragraphs 2.39 and 2.40.
"However, the term does include volatile organic compounds (VOCs)."
"As stated in Limitations on Requirements above, measures described in this document are the minimum that are needed to comply with the Building Regulations."
Further actions may be necessary to deal with the requirements of other legislation.
Landfill gas is generated by the action of micro-organisms on biodegradable waste materials in landfill sites.
It generally consists of methane and carbon dioxide together with small quantities of VOCs which give the gas its characteristic odour.
Methane and oxygen deficient atmospheres (sometimes referred to as stythe or black-damp) containing elevated levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen can be generated naturally in coal mining areas.
Methane and carbon dioxide can also be produced by organic rich soils and sediments such as peat and river silts.
"A wide range of VOCs can also be present as a result of petrol, oil and solvent spillages."
Methane and other gases can migrate through the subsoil and through cracks and fissures into buildings.
Methane is an explosive and asphyxiating gas.
Carbon dioxide although non-flammable is toxic.
"VOCs are not only flammable and toxic but can also have a strong, unpleasant odour."
Should any of these gases build up to hazardous levels in buildings then they can cause harm to health or compromise safety.
The risk assessment process outlined in paragraph 2.8 should also be adopted for methane and other gases.
"Further investigation for hazardous soil gases may be required where the ground to be covered by the building and/or any land associated with the building is: a. On a landfill site, within 250m of the boundary of a landfill site or where there is suspicion that it is within the sphere of influence of such a site."
The Environment Agency’s policy on building development on or near to landfills should be followed.
On a site subject to the wide scale deposition of biodegradable substances (including made ground or fill).
"On a site that has been subject to a use that could give rise to petrol, oil or solvent spillages."
"In an area subject to naturally occurring methane, carbon dioxide and other hazardous gases (e.g. hydrogen sulphide)."
There are documents that cover hazardous soil gases in these specific contexts:
Waste Management Paper No. 2760 gives guidance on the generation and movement of landfill gas as well as techniques for its investigation.
Complementary guidance is given in a document61 by the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM).

"HMIP Waste Management Paper No. 27 Landfill gas, 2nd edition, 1991."
"Monitoring of landfill gas, Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM), 2nd edition, 1998."
The Institute of Petroleum has prepared a guidance document covering petroleum retail sites62.
"The BGS report on naturally occurring methane and other gases63 gives guidance on the geographical extent of these contaminants, the associated hazards and methods of site investigation."
This is supported by a report sponsored by the former DoE on methane and other gases in disused coal mining areas64.
"In addition, CIRIA has produced three relevant guidance documents on methane and other gases which describe how such gases are generated and move within the ground65, methods of detection and monitoring66 and investigation strategies67."
During a site investigation for methane and other gases it is important to take measurements over a sufficiently long period of time in order to characterise gas emissions fully.
"This should also include periods when gas emissions are likely to be higher, e.g. during periods of falling atmospheric pressure."
"It is also important to establish not only the concentration of these gases in the ground but also the quantity of gas generating materials, their rate of gas generation, gas movement in the ground and gas emissions from the ground surface."
This is an important part of the risk estimation stage.
"Indications about the gas regime in the ground can be obtained through surface emission rate and borehole flow rate measurements, and guidance on this is given in CIRIA Reports 15168 and 15269."
Construction activities undertaken as part of building development can alter the gas regime on the site.
"When assessing gas risks in the context of traditional housing there is a need to consider two pathways for human receptors: (i) gas entering the dwelling through the sub-structure, and building up to hazardous levels, and (ii) subsequent householder exposure in garden areas which can include where outbuildings (e.g. garden sheds and greenhouses) and extensions are constructed, and where there may also be excavations for garden features (e.g. ponds)."
"Guidance on undertaking gas risk assessment is given in CIRIA Report 15269, and the GaSIM model is also available for assessing gas emissions from landfill sites70."
Environment Agency document CLR 1143.
"CIRIA Report 14972 and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) Partners in Technology (PIT) report73 describe a range of ground gas regimes (defined in terms of soil gas concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide as well as borehole flow rate measurements) which can be helpful in assessing gas risks."
"Depending on the proposed use, for non-domestic development the focus might be on the building only, but the general approach is the same."
If the risks posed by the gas are 2.36 unacceptable then these need to be managed through appropriate building remedial measures.
Site-wide gas control measures may be required if the risks on any land associated with the building are deemed unacceptable.
Such control measures include removal of the gas generating material or covering together with gas extraction systems.
Further guidance is contained in CIRIA Report 14972.
"Generally speaking, expert advice should be sought in these circumstances."
Gas control measures for dwellings consist of a gas resistant barrier across the whole footprint (i.e. walls and floor) above an extraction (or ventilation) layer from which gases can be dispersed and vented to the atmosphere.
"They are normally passive, i.e. gas flow is driven by stack (temperature difference) and wind effects."
Consideration should be given to the design and layout of buildings to maximise the driving forces of natural ventilation.
Further guidance on this and detailed practical guidance on the construction of protective measures for housing is given in the BRE/Environment Agency report 43 CLR 11.

The DETR/Arup Environmental report74 compares the performance of a range of commonly used gas control measures and can be used as a guide to the design of such measures.
"Gas control measures for non-domestic buildings use the same principles as those used for housing, and the DETR/Arup Environmental report can also be used as a guide to design."
Expert advice should be sought as the floor area of such buildings can be large and it is important to ensure that gas is adequately dispersed from beneath the floor.
The use of mechanical (as opposed to passive) systems and monitoring and alarm systems may be necessary.
"There is a need for continued maintenance and calibration of these systems, so they are more appropriate with non-domestic buildings (as opposed to dwellings) since there is usually scope for this."
"Again, expert advice should be sought."
Special sub-floor ventilation systems are carefully designed to ensure adequate performance and should not be modified unless subjected to a specialist review of the design.
"Such ventilation systems, particularly those using powered ventilation, are unlikely to be appropriate for owner occupied properties as there is a risk of interference by users."
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive colourless and odourless gas which is formed in small quantities by radioactive decay wherever uranium and radium are found.
It can move through the subsoil and so into buildings.
"Some parts of the country, notably the West Country, have higher levels than elsewhere."
Exposure to high levels for long periods increases the risk of developing lung cancer.
"To reduce this risk all new buildings, extensions and conversions, whether residential or non-domestic, built in areas where there may be elevated radon emissions, may need to incorporate precautions against radon."
"Guidance on whether an area is susceptible to radon, and appropriate protective measures, can be obtained from BRE Report BR 21175."
The maps in BR 211 are based on the indicative atlas published by Public Health England (formerly the Health Protection Agency) and the British Geological Survey.
Radon risk reports may be used as an alternative approach to the maps for assessing the need for protective measures.
These reports are available from:
"UK Radon, www.UKradon.org, for small domestic and workplace buildings (and extensions) that have an existing postal address."
"Georeports, for other development sites."
"Public Health England (formerly the Health Protection Agency), radon@phe.gov.uk, for large workplaces."
BR 211 provides guidance on basic radon protective measures appropriate in areas where 3% to 10% of homes and full radon protective measures in areas where more than 10% of homes are predicted to have radon at or above the Radon Action Level of 200Bq/m3.
"Note: Use of the alternative radon risk reports approach will provide a more accurate assessment of whether radon protective measures are necessary and, if needed, the level of protection that is appropriate."
The Ionising Radiations Regulations76 and other legislation set out relevant requirements including a national reference level for radon in workplaces.
See also the BRE guide Radon in the workplace77.
"Additionally, techniques for installing radon resistant membranes described in BR 211 may be suitable for use in domestic sized buildings with heating and ventilation regimes similar to those used in dwellings but this should be done with caution."

"The provisions which follow assume that 3.1 the site of the building is not subject to general flooding (see paragraph 0.8) or, if it is, that appropriate steps are being taken."
"Where the water table can rise to within 0.25m of the lowest floor of the building, or where surface water could enter or adversely affect the building, either the ground to be covered by the building should be drained by gravity, or other effective means of safeguarding the building should be taken."
If an active subsoil drain is cut during 3.3 excavation and if it passes under the building it should be:
re-laid in pipes with sealed joints and have access points outside the building; or
re-routed around the building; or
re-run to another outfall (see Diagram 3).
"Where there is a risk that groundwater beneath or around the building could adversely affect the stability and properties of the ground, consideration should be given to site drainage or other protection (see Section 4: Floors)."
"For protecting low lying buildings or 3.5 basements from localised flooding where foul water drainage also receives rainwater, refer to Approved Document H (Drainage and waste disposal)."
In heavy rainfall these systems surcharge and where preventative measures are not taken this could lead to increased risks of flooding within the property.
"Flooding can create blockages in drains 3.6 and sewers that can lead to backflow of sewage into properties through low level drain gullies, toilets, etc. Guidance on anti-flooding devices is given in a CIRIA publication79."
General excavation work for foundations and services can alter groundwater flows through the site.
"Where contaminants are present in the ground, consideration should be given to subsoil drainage to prevent the transportation of water-borne contaminants to the foundations or into the building or its services."
"CIRIA Publication C506 Low-cost options for prevention of flooding from sewers, 1998."
This section gives guidance for five 4.1 situations:
ground supported floors exposed to moisture from the ground (see paragraphs 4.6 to 4.12);
suspended timber ground floors exposed to moisture from the ground (see paragraphs 4.13 to 4.16);
suspended concrete ground floors exposed to moisture from the ground (see paragraphs 4.17 to 4.20);
the risk of interstitial condensation in ground floors and floors exposed from below (see paragraph 4.21);
the risk of surface condensation and mould growth on any type of floor (see paragraph 4.22).
Floors next to the ground should:
resist the passage of ground moisture to the upper surface of the floor;
not be damaged by moisture from the ground;
not be damaged by groundwater;
resist the passage of ground gases.
To meet requirement C1 (2) floors in some localities may need to resist the passage of hazardous ground gases such as radon or methane.
"Remedial measures will include a gas resistant barrier which, with proper detailing, can also function as a damp proof membrane."
"For specific guidance for methane and other gases refer to paragraphs 2.25 to 2.38, and for radon refer to paragraphs 2.39 and 2.40."
Guidance is provided in reports BR 41480 and BR 21175 respectively.
Consideration should be given to whether 4.2(a) need apply to a building used wholly for:
"storing goods, provided that any persons who are habitually employed in the building are engaged only in taking in, caring for or taking out the goods; or"
a purpose such that the provision would not serve to increase protection to the health or safety of any persons habitually employed in the building.

"A membrane below the concrete could 4.8 be formed with a sheet of polyethylene, which should be at least 300µm thick (1200 gauge) with sealed joints and laid on a bed of material that will not damage the sheet."
A membrane laid above the concrete may 4.9 be either polyethylene sheet as described above (but without the bedding material) or three coats of cold applied bitumen solution or similar moisture and water vapour resisting material.
"In each case it should be protected by either a screed or a floor finish, unless the membrane is pitchmastic or similar material which will also serve as a floor finish."
Insulants placed beneath floor slabs 4.10 should have sufficient strength to resist the weight of the slab and the anticipated floor loading as well as any possible overloading during construction.
In order to resist degradation insulation that is placed below the damp proof membrane should have low water absorption.
If necessary the insulant should be resistant to contaminants in the ground.
A timber floor finish laid directly on concrete may be bedded in a material which may also serve as a damp-proof membrane.
Some preservative treatments are described in BS 1282:199986.
The requirement can also be achieved by following the relevant recommendations of Clause 11 of BS CP 102:197387.
BS 8102:199088 includes recommendations for floors subject to water pressure.
Any suspended timber floor next to the ground will meet the requirement if:
the ground is covered so as to resist moisture and prevent plant growth; and
there is a ventilated air space between the ground covering and the timber; and

"In shrinkable clay soils, the depth of the air space may need to be increased to allow for heave."
"In areas such as kitchens, utility rooms 4.15 and bathrooms where water may be spilled, any board used as a flooring, irrespective of the storey, should be moisture resistant."
In the case of chipboard it should be of one of the grades with improved moisture resistance specified in BS 7331:199091 or BS EN 312 Part 5:199792.
"It should be laid, fixed and jointed in the manner recommended by the manufacturer."
To demonstrate compliance the identification marks should be facing upwards.
Any softwood boarding should be at least 20mm thick and from a durable species93 or treated with a suitable preservative.
The requirement can also be met (see paragraph 4.14 above) by following the relevant recommendations of Clause 11 of BS CP 102:197394.
"Any suspended floor of in situ or precast concrete, including beam and block floors, next to the ground will meet the requirement if it will adequately prevent the passage of moisture to the upper surface and if the reinforcement is protected against moisture."
One solution for a suspended concrete floor could be:
in situ concrete at least 100mm thick (but thicker if the structural design requires) containing at least 300kg of cement for each m3 of concrete; or
precast concrete construction with or without infilling slabs; and
reinforcing steel protected by concrete cover of at least 40mm if the concrete is in situ and at least the thickness required for a moderate exposure if the concrete is precast.
A suspended concrete floor will meet the requirements if it incorporates:
a damp-proof membrane (if the ground below the floor has been excavated below the lowest level of the surrounding ground and will not be effectively drained); and
a ventilated air space.
This should measure at least 150mm clear from the ground to the underside of the floor (or insulation if provided).
Two opposing external walls should have ventilation openings placed so that the ventilating air will have a free path between opposite sides and to all parts of the floor void.
"The openings should be not less than either 1500mm2/m run of external wall or 500mm2/m2 of floor area, whichever gives the greater opening area."
Any pipes needed to carry ventilating air should have a diameter of at least 100mm.
Ventilation openings should incorporate suitable grilles which prevent the entry of vermin to the sub-floor but do not resist the air flow unduly.

This section gives guidance for four 5.1 situations:
internal and external walls exposed to moisture from the ground (see paragraphs 5.4 to 5.6);
"external walls exposed to precipitation from the outside, covering: i. solid external walls (see paragraphs 5.8 to 5.11);"
cavity external walls (see paragraphs 5.12 to 5.15);
framed external walls (see paragraph 5.17);
cracking of walls (see paragraph 5.18);

the joint between window and door frames and external walls and door thresholds (see paragraphs 5.29 to 5.33);
the risk of interstitial condensation in any type of wall (see paragraphs 5.34 to 5.35);
the risk of surface condensation or mould growth on any type of wall (see paragraph 5.36).
"A wall includes piers, columns and parapets."
It also includes chimneys if they are attached to the building.
"It does not include windows, doors and similar openings, but does include the joint between their frames and the wall."
"In the following, the term ‘precipitation’ includes the effects of spray blown from the sea or any other body of water adjacent to the building."
resist the passage of moisture from the ground to the inside of the building; and
"not be damaged by moisture from the ground and not carry moisture from the ground to any part which would be damaged by it, and, if the wall is an external wall:"
resist the penetration of precipitation to components of the structure that might be damaged by moisture; and
resist the penetration of precipitation to the inside of the building; and
be designed and constructed so that their structural and thermal performance are not adversely affected by interstitial condensation; and
"not promote surface condensation or mould growth, given reasonable occupancy conditions."
Consideration should be given to whether provisions 5.2(a) and (d) need apply to a building used wholly for:
"storing goods, provided that any persons who are habitually employed in the building are engaged only in taking in, caring for or taking out the goods; or"
a purpose such that the provision would not serve to increase protection to the health or safety of any persons habitually employed in the building.
Any internal or external wall will meet the 5.4 requirement if a damp proof course is provided.
"An internal or external wall will meet the Technical solution requirement if it is built as follows (unless it is subject to groundwater pressure, in which case see the Alternative approach – paragraph 5.6):"
"damp-proof course of bituminous material, polyethylene, engineering bricks or slates in cement mortar or any other material that will prevent the passage of moisture."
The damp proof course should be continuous with any damp-proof membrane in the floors; and
"if the wall is an external wall, the damp-proof course should be at least 150mm above the level of the adjoining ground (see Diagram 8), unless the design is such that a part of the building will protect the wall; and"
"if the wall is an external cavity wall, (see Diagram 9a) the cavity should be taken down at least 225mm below the level of the lowest damp-proof course, or a damp-proof tray should be provided so as to prevent precipitation passing into the inner leaf (see Diagram 9b), with weep holes every 900mm to assist in the transfer of moisture through the external leaf."
"Where the damp-proof tray does not extend the full length of the exposed wall, i.e. above an opening, stop ends and at least two weep holes should be provided."
The requirement can also be met by 5.6 following the relevant recommendations of Clauses 4 and 5 of BS 8215:1991101.
BS 8102:1990102 101 BS 8215:1991 Code of practice for design and installation of damp-proof courses in masonry construction.
BS 8102:1990 Code of practice for protection of structures against water from the ground.
Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture Approved Document CONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION WALLS includes recommendations for walls subject to groundwater pressure including basement walls.
"As well as giving protection against 5.7 moisture from the ground, an external wall should give protection against precipitation."
"This protection can be given by a solid wall of sufficient thickness (see paragraphs 5.8 to 5.11), or by a cavity wall (see paragraphs 5.12 to 5.18), or by an impervious or weather-resisting cladding (see paragraphs 5.19 to 5.28)."
"Any solid wall will meet the requirement if it will hold moisture arising from rain and snow until it can be released in a dry period without penetrating to the inside of the building, or causing damage to the building."
The wall thickness will depend on the type of brick and block and on the severity of wind-driven rain.
A method of describing the exposure to wind-driven rain is given in BS 8104:1992103; see also BS 5628-3:2001104.
"A solid external wall in conditions of very severe exposure should be protected by external impervious cladding, but in conditions of severe exposure may be built as follows:"
"brickwork or stonework at least 328mm thick, dense aggregate concrete blockwork at least 250mm thick, or lightweight aggregate or aerated autoclaved concrete blockwork at least 215mm thick; and"
rendering: the exposed face of the bricks or blocks should be rendered or be given no less protection.
Rendering should be in two coats with a total thickness of at least 20mm and should have a scraped or textured finish.
The strength of the mortar should be compatible with the strength of the bricks or blocks.
"The joints, if the wall is to be rendered, should be raked out to a depth of at least 10mm."
Further guidance is given in BS EN 998:2003105.
"The rendering mix should be one part of cement, one part of lime and six parts of well graded sharp sand (nominal mix 1:1:6) unless the blocks are of dense concrete aggregate, in which case the mix may be 1:0.5:4."
BS 5262:1991106 includes recommendations for a wider range of mixes according to the severity of exposure and the type of brick or block.
Premixed and proprietary renders should be used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions;
"protection should be provided where the top of walls, etc. would otherwise be unprotected (see Diagram 10)."
"Unless the protection and joints will be a complete barrier to moisture, a damp-proof course should also be provided;"
"damp-proof courses, cavity trays and closers should be provided and designed to ensure that water drains outwards:"
"where the downward flow will be interrupted by an obstruction, such as some types of lintel; and"
"under openings, unless there is a sill and the sill and its joints will form a complete barrier; and"
at abutments between walls and roofs.
A solid external wall may be 5.10 insulated on the inside or on the outside.
Where it is on the inside a cavity should be provided to give a break in the path for moisture and where it is on the outside it should provide some resistance to the ingress of moisture to ensure the wall remains relatively dry (see Diagram 11).

The requirement can also be met by following the relevant recommendations of BS 5628-3:2001107.
The code describes alternative constructions to suit the severity of the exposure and the type of brick or block.
"Any external cavity wall will meet the requirement if the outer leaf is separated from the inner leaf by a drained air space, or in any other way which will prevent precipitation from being carried to the inner leaf."
The construction of a cavity external wall could include:
"outer leaf masonry (bricks, blocks, stone or manufactured stone); and"
cavity at least 50mm wide.
"The cavity is to be bridged only by wall ties, cavity trays provided to prevent moisture being carried to the inner leaf (see paragraph 5.15 for cavity insulation), and cavity barriers, firestops and cavity closures, where appropriate; and"
inner leaf masonry or frame with lining.
Masonry units should be laid on a full bed of mortar with the cross joints substantially and continuously filled to ensure structural robustness and weather resistance.
"Where a cavity is to be partially filled, the residual cavity should not be less than 50mm wide (see Diagram 11)."
The requirement can also be met by following the relevant recommendations of BS 5628-3:2001108.
The code describes factors affecting rain penetration of cavity walls.
A full or partial fill insulating material may be placed in the cavity between the outer leaf and an inner leaf of masonry subject to the following conditions:
The suitability of a wall for installing insulation into the cavity should be determined either by reference to the map in Diagram 12 and the associated Table 4 or following the calculation or assessment procedure in current British or CEN standards.
"When partial fill materials are to be used, the residual cavity should not be less than 50mm nominal; and"
A rigid (board or batt) thermal insulating material built into the wall should be the subject of current certification from an appropriate body or a European Technical Approval and the work should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of that document; or
Other insulating materials inserted into the cavity after the wall has been constructed should have certification from an appropriate body and be installed in accordance with the appropriate installations code.
The suitability of the wall for filling is to be assessed before the work is carried out and the person undertaking the work should operate under an Approved Installer Scheme that includes an assessment of capability.
Alternatively the insulating material should be the subject of current certification from an appropriate body or a European Technical Approval and the work should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of that document by operatives either directly employed by the holder of the document or employed by an installer approved to operate under the document; or
Urea-formaldehyde foam inserted into the cavity should be in accordance with BS 5617:1985109 and be installed in accordance with BS 5618:1985110.
The suitability of the wall for foam filling is to be assessed before the work is carried out and the person undertaking the work should operate under an Approved Installer Scheme that includes an assessment of capability.
"When the cavity of an existing house is being filled, special attention should be given to the condition of the external leaf of the wall, e.g. its state of repair and type of pointing."
Guidance is given in BS 8208-1:1985111.
Some materials that are used to fill existing cavity walls may have a low risk of moisture being carried over to the internal leaf of the wall.
"In cases where a third party assessment of such a cavity fill material contains a method of assessing the construction of the walls and exposure risk, the procedure set out below may be replaced by that method."

Determine the recommended constructions from the modified exposure zone values given in Table 4. Further guidance as to the use of this table is given in BRE Report 262113.
"Any framed external wall will meet the requirement if the cladding is separated from the insulation or sheathing by a vented and drained cavity with a membrane that is vapour open, but resists the passage of liquid water, on the inside of the cavity (see Diagram 11)."
Severe rain penetration may occur through cracks in masonry external walls caused by thermal movement in hot weather or subsidence after prolonged droughts.
The possibility of this should be taken into account when designing a building.
Detailed guidance is given in:
"BRE Building Elements: Walls, windows and doors114; and"
Guidance for choice of materials is given in BS 5628-3:2001116.
Cladding systems for walls should:
resist the penetration of precipitation to the inside of the building; and
not be damaged by precipitation and not carry precipitation to any part of the building which would be damaged by it.
Cladding can be designed to protect a building from precipitation (often driven by the wind) either by holding it at the face of the building or by stopping it from penetrating beyond the back of the cladding.
Any cladding will meet the requirement if:
"it is jointless or has sealed joints, and is impervious to moisture (so that moisture will not enter the cladding); or"
"it has overlapping dry joints, is impervious or weather resisting, and is backed by a material which will direct precipitation which enters the cladding towards the outer face."
"Some materials can deteriorate rapidly without special care and they should only be used as the weather-resisting part of a cladding system if certain conditions are met (see Approved Document 7, Materials and workmanship)."
"The weather-resisting part of a cladding system does not include paint nor does it include any coating, surfacing or rendering which will not itself provide all the weather resistance."
Cladding may be:
"impervious including metal, plastic, glass and bituminous products; or"
"weather resisting including natural stone or slate, cement based products, fired clay and wood; or"
"moisture resisting including bituminous and plastic products lapped at the joints, if used as a sheet material, and permeable to water vapour unless there is a ventilated space directly behind the material; or"
"jointless materials and sealed joints, which would allow for structural and thermal movement."
"Dry joints between cladding units should be designed so that precipitation will not pass through them, or the cladding should be designed so that precipitation which enters the joints will be directed towards the exposed face without it penetrating beyond the back of the cladding."
Note: Whether dry joints are suitable will depend on the design of the joint or the design of the cladding and the severity of the exposure to wind and rain.
"Each sheet, tile and section of cladding should be securely fixed."
Particular care should be taken with detailing and workmanship at the junctions between cladding and window and door openings as they are vulnerable to moisture ingress.
Insulation can be incorporated into the 5.26 construction provided it is either protected from moisture or unaffected by it.
"Where cladding is supported by timber components or is on the façade of a timber framed building, the space between the cladding and the building should be ventilated to ensure rapid drying of any water that penetrates the cladding."

Recommendations for lead are included in BS 6915:2001119;
MCRMA Technical Paper 6124;
MCRMA Technical Paper 9125.
These documents describe the materials and contain design considerations including recommendations for fixing.
The joint between walls and door and window frames should:
resist the penetration of precipitation to the inside of the building; and
not be damaged by precipitation and not permit precipitation to reach any part of the building which would be damaged by it.
Damp-proof courses should be provided to direct moisture towards the outside:
"where the downward flow of moisture would be interrupted at an obstruction, e.g. at a lintel;"
"where sill elements, including joints, do not form a complete barrier to the transfer of precipitation, e.g. under openings, windows and doors;"
"where reveal elements, including joints, do not form a complete barrier to the transfer of rain and snow, e.g. at openings, windows and doors."
In some cases the width of the cavity due 5.31 to thermal insulation and the 50mm clearance for drainage may be such that the window frame is not wide enough to completely cover the cavity closer.
"The reveal may need to be lined with plasterboard, dry lining, a support system or a thermal backing board."
Direct plastering of the internal reveal should only be used with a backing of expanded metal lathing or similar.
In areas of the country in driving rain 5.32 exposure zone 4 checked rebates should be used in all window and door reveals.
"The frame should be set back behind the outer leaf of masonry, which should overlap it as shown in Diagram 13."
Alternatively an insulated finned cavity closer may be used.

"An external wall will meet the requirement if it is designed and constructed in accordance with Clause 8.3 of BS 5250:2002129, and BS EN ISO 13788:2002130."
"Because of the high internal temperatures and humidities, there is a particular risk of interstitial condensation in the walls of swimming pools and other buildings in which high levels of moisture are generated; specialist advice should be sought when these are being designed."
An external wall will meet the requirement if: a. it is designed and constructed so that the thermal transmittance (U-value) does not exceed 0.7W/m2K at any point; and
"the junctions between elements and details of openings, such as doors and windows, are designed to Accredited Construction Details99, or follow the guidance of BRE IP17/01132."

the risk of condensation or mould growth on the internal surface of roofs (see paragraph 6.14).
resist the penetration of precipitation to the inside of the building; and
not be damaged by precipitation and not carry precipitation to any part of the building which would be damaged by it;
be designed and constructed so that their structural and thermal performance are not adversely affected by interstitial condensation.
Roofing can be designed to protect a building from precipitation either by holding the precipitation at the face of the roof or by stopping it from penetrating beyond the back of the roofing system.
Any roof will meet the requirement if:
"it is jointless or has sealed joints, and is impervious to moisture (so that moisture will not enter the roofing system); or"
"moisture resisting including bituminous and plastic products lapped at the joints, if used as a sheet material, and permeable to water vapour unless there is a ventilated space directly behind the material; or"
"jointless materials and sealed joints, which would allow for structural and thermal movement."
"Dry joints between roofing sheets should be designed so that precipitation will not pass through them, or the system should be designed so that precipitation which enters the joints will be drained away without penetrating beyond the back of the roofing system."
Note: Whether dry joints are suitable will depend on the design of the joint or the design of the roofing system and the severity of the exposure to wind and rain.
"Each sheet, tile and section of roof should 6.8 be fixed in an appropriate manner."
Guidance as to appropriate fixing methods is given in BS 8000-6:1990134.
The requirement can also be met by 6.9 following the relevant recommendations of:
BS CP 143135 for sheet roof and wall coverings made from the following materials:
"it has overlapping dry joints, is impervious or weather resisting, and is backed by a material which will direct precipitation which enters the roof towards the outer face (as with roofing felt)."
"Some materials can deteriorate rapidly 6.5 without special care and they should only be used as the weather-resisting part of a roof if certain conditions are met (see Approved Document 7, Materials and workmanship133)."
"The weather-resisting part of a roofing system does not include paint nor does it include any coating, surfacing or rendering which will not itself provide all the weather resistance."

These documents describe the materials and contain design considerations including recommendations for fixing.
A roof will meet the requirement if it is designed and constructed in accordance with Clause 8.4 of BS 5250:2002141 and BS EN ISO 13788:2002142.
Further guidance is given in the BRE Report BR 262143.
"The requirement will be met by the ventilation of cold deck roofs, i.e. those roofs where the moisture from the building can permeate the insulation."
For the purposes of health and safety it may not always be necessary to provide ventilation to small roofs such as those over porches and bay windows.
"Although a part of a roof which has a pitch of 70° or more is to be insulated as though it were a wall, the provisions in this document apply to roofs of any pitch."
"To avoid excessive moisture transfer to roof voids gaps and penetrations for pipes and electrical wiring should be filled and sealed; this is particularly important in areas of high humidity, e.g. bathrooms and kitchens."
An effective draught seal should be provided to loft hatches to reduce inflow of warm air and moisture.
"Because of the high internal temperatures and humidities, there is a particular risk of interstitial condensation in the roofs of swimming pools and other buildings in which high levels of moisture are generated; specialist advice should be sought when these are being designed."
A roof will meet the requirement if:
it is designed and constructed so that the thermal transmittance (U-value) does not exceed 0.35W/m2K at any point; and
"the junctions between elements and the details of openings, such as windows, are designed to Accredited Construction Details99, or follow the guidance of BRE IP17/01145 or MCRMA Paper 14146 for profiled metal roofing."

This document is one of a series that has been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of Schedule 1 to and Regulation 7 of the Building Regulations 2010 for England and Wales.
At the back of this document is a list of all the documents that have been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for this purpose.
Approved Documents are intended to provide guidance for some of the more common building situations.
"However, there may well be alternative ways of achieving compliance with the requirements."
Thus there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an Approved Document if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way.
The guidance contained in an Approved Document relates only to the particular requirements of the Regulations which the document addresses.
The building work will also have to comply with the requirements of any other relevant paragraphs in Schedule 1 to the Regulations.
There are Approved Documents which give guidance on each of the parts of Schedule 1 and on Regulation 7.
"In accordance with Regulation 8, the requirements in Part D of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations do not require anything to be done except for the purpose of securing reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about buildings (and any others who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings)."
Any building work which is subject to the requirements imposed by Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations shall be carried out in accordance with regulation 7. Guidance on meeting these requirements on materials and workmanship is contained in Approved Document 7.
"Building Regulations are made for specific purposes, primarily the health and safety, welfare and convenience of people and for energy conservation."
Standards and other technical specifications may provide relevant guidance to the extent that they relate to these considerations.
"However, they may also address other aspects of performance or matters which, although they relate to health and safety etc., are not covered by the Building Regulations."
"When an Approved Document makes reference to a named standard, the relevant version of the standard to which it refers is the one listed at the end of the publication."
"However, if this version has been revised or updated by the issuing standards body, the new version may be used as a source of guidance provided it continues to address the relevant requirements of the Regulations."
"The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 contain some requirements which affect building design."
"The main requirements are now covered by the Building Regulations, but for further information see: Workplace health, safety and welfare."
"Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."
"Approved code of practice and guidance, 1998."
"The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 apply to the common parts of flats and similar buildings if people such as cleaners and caretakers are employed to work in these common parts."
"Where the requirements of the Building Regulations that are covered by this part do not apply to dwellings, the provisions may still be required in the situations described above in order to satisfy the Workplace Regulations."
This Approved Document deals with the following Requirement from Part D of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
"If insulating material is inserted into a cavity in a cavity wall, reasonable precautions shall be taken to prevent the subsequent permeation of any toxic fumes from that material into any part of the building occupied by people."
To reduce the risks to the health of persons in buildings formaldehyde fumes given off by urea formaldehyde foams should not penetrate to the occupied parts of buildings to an extent which would give rise to an irritant concentration.
Insulating materials which give off formaldehyde fumes (either when used or later in normal use) may be used to insulate the cavity in a cavity wall where there is a continuous barrier which will minimise as far as practicable the passage of fumes to the occupiable parts.
A cavity wall may be insulated with UF 1.2 foam where:
the inner leaf of the wall is built of masonry (bricks or blocks); and
the suitability of the wall for foam filling is assessed before the work is carried out in accordance with BS 8208-1:1985 Guide to assessment of suitability of external cavity walls for filling with thermal insulants.
Existing traditional cavity construction; and
the person carrying out the work holds (or operates under) a current Certificate of Registration of Assessed Capability for the work he is doing; and 
the material is in accordance with the relevant recommendations of BS 5617:1985 Specifications for urea formaldehyde (UF) foam systems suitable for thermal insulation of cavity walls with masonry or concrete inner and outer leaves; and 
the installation is in accordance with BS 5618:1985 Code of practice for thermal insulation of cavity walls (with masonry or concrete inner and outer leaves) by filling with urea formaldehyde (UF) foam systems.

Any building work which is subject to the requirements imposed by Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations shall be carried out in accordance with regulation 7. Guidance on meeting these requirements on materials and workmanship is contained in Approved Document 7.
"Building Regulations are made for specific purposes, primarily the health and safety, welfare and convenience of people and for energy conservation."
Standards and other technical specifications may provide relevant guidance to the extent that they relate to these considerations.
"However, they may also address other aspects of performance or matters which, although they relate to health and safety etc., are not covered by the Building Regulations."

"This document is one of a series that has been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of Schedule 1 to, and Regulation 7 of, the Building Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/2214) for England and Wales."
At the back of this document is a list of all the documents that have been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for this purpose.
Approved Documents are intended to provide guidance for some of the more common building situations.
"However, there may well be alternative ways of achieving compliance with the requirements."
Thus there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an Approved Document if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way.
The guidance contained in an Approved Document relates only to the particular requirements of the Regulations which the document addresses.
The building work will also have to comply with the requirements of any other relevant paragraphs in Schedule 1 to the Regulations.
There are Approved Documents which give guidance on each of the parts of Schedule 1 and on Regulation 7.
"In accordance with Regulation 8, the requirements in Parts A to D, F to K and N (except for paragraphs H2 and J7) of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations do not require anything to be done except for the purpose of securing reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about buildings (and any others who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings)."
This is one of the categories of purpose for which building regulations may be made.
Paragraphs H2 and J7 are excluded from Regulation 8 because they deal directly with prevention of the contamination of water.
"Parts E and M (which deal, respectively, with resistance to the passage of sound, and access and facilities for disabled people) are excluded from Regulation 8 because they address the welfare and convenience of building users."
Part L is excluded from Regulation 8 because it addresses the conservation of fuel and power.
"All these matters are amongst the purposes, other than health and safety, that may be addressed by Building Regulations."
"This Approved Document, which took effect on 1 July 2003, deals with the Requirements of Part E of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010."
Requirement E2 does not apply to:
an internal wall which contains a door;
an internal wall which separates an en suite toilet from the associated bedroom;
existing walls and floors in a building which is subject to a material change of use.
"Requirement E3 only applies to corridors, stairwells, hallways and entrance halls which give access to the flat or room for residential purposes."
"Dwelling-houses, flats and rooms for residential purposes shall be designed and constructed in such a way that they provide reasonable resistance to sound from other parts of the same building and from adjoining buildings."
Protection against sound within a dwelling-house etc.
"Dwelling-houses, flats and rooms for residential purposes shall be designed and constructed in such a way that:"
"internal walls between a bedroom or a room containing a water closet, and other rooms; and"
provide reasonable resistance to sound.
The common internal parts of buildings which contain flats or rooms for residential purposes shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent more reverberation around the common parts than is reasonable.
Each room or other space in a school building shall be designed and constructed in such a way that it has the acoustic conditions and the insulation against disturbance by noise appropriate to its intended use.
For the purposes of this Part – ‘school’ has the same meaning as in Section 4 of the Education Act 1996[4]; and ‘school building’ means any building forming a school or part of a school.
Section 4 was amended by Schedule 22 to the Education Act 1997 (c. 44).
Attention is drawn to the following extracts from the Building Regulations 2010.
"Interpretation (Regulation 2) ‘room for residential purposes’ means a room, or a suite of rooms, which is not a dwelling-house or a flat and which is used by one or more persons to live and sleep and includes a room in a hostel, an hotel, a boarding house, a hall of residence or a residential home, but does not include a room in a hospital, or other similar establishment, used for patient accommodation."
"For the purposes of paragraph 8 (1)(e) of Schedule 1 to the Act and for the purposes of these Regulations, there is a material change of use where there is a change in the purposes for which or the circumstances in which a building is used, so that after the change:"
"the building is used as a dwelling, where previously it was not;"
"the building contains a flat, where previously it did not;"
"the building is used as an hotel or boarding house, where previously it was not;"
"the building is used as an institution, where previously it was not;"
"the building is used as a public building, where previously it was not;"
"the building is not a building described in Classes 1 to 6 in Schedule 2, where previously it was;"
"the building, which contains at least one dwelling, contains a greater or lesser number of dwellings than it did previously;"
"the building contains a room for residential purposes, where previously it did not; or"
"the building, which contains at least one room for residential purposes, contains a greater or lesser number of such rooms than it did previously."
"the building is used as a shop, where previously it was not."
Where there is a material change of use of 1.
"the whole of a building, such work, if any, shall be carried out as is necessary to ensure that the building complies with the applicable requirements of the following paragraphs of Schedule 1:"
"in all cases,"
"in the case of a material change of use described in Regulations 5(c),(d), (e) or (f), A1 to A3 (structure);"
"in the case of a building exceeding fifteen metres in height, B4(1) (external fire spread – walls);"
"in the case of a material change of use described in Regulation 5(a), (b), (c), (d), (g), (h), (i) or, where the material change of use provides new residential accommodation, (f), C1 (2) (resistance to contaminants);"
"in the case of material change of use described in Regulation 5(a), C2 (resistance to moisture);"
"in the case of a material change of use described in Regulation 5(a), (b), (c), (g), (h) or (i) E1 to E3;"
"in the case of a material change of use described in Regulation 5(e), where the public building consists of or contains a school, E4 (acoustic conditions in schools);"
"in the case of a material change of use described in regulation 5(a) or (b), G2 (water efficiency) and G3(4) (hot water supply and systems: hot water supply to fixed baths);"
"in the case of a material change of use described in regulation 5(c), (d), (e) or (j), M1 (access and use)."

For the purposes of Approved Document E the following definitions apply:
"Adjoining dwelling-houses, adjoining flats, adjoining rooms for residential purposes and adjoining buildings are those in direct physical contact with another dwelling-house, flat, room for residential purposes or building."
‘Historic buildings’: Historic buildings include:
vernacular buildings of traditional form and construction.
"In the Secretary of State’s view the normal way of satisfying Requirement E1 will be to build separating walls, separating floors, and stairs that have a separating function, together with the associated flanking construction, in such a way that they achieve the sound insulation values for dwelling-houses and flats set out in Table 1a, and the values for rooms for residential purposes (see definition in Regulation 2) set out in Table 1b."
"For walls that separate rooms for residential purposes from adjoining dwelling-houses and flats, the performance standards given in Table 1a should be achieved."
"Regulations 2010 apply to building work to which Requirement E1 applies, and require appropriate sound insulation testing to be carried out."
"The exception is that, in the case of new-build houses and buildings containing flats, Regulations 41 and 20(1) and (5) do not apply to any relevant part of the building where the design embodies a design detail or details from the set approved and published by Robust Details Ltd; a valid notification is given to the building control body; and the actual work complies with the detail or details specified in the notification."
"Subject to this exception, which is further explained in Annex E: Design details approved by Robust Details Ltd, Regulation 44 applies where building control is being carried out by a local authority, and Regulation 20(1) and (5) applies where it is being carried out by an Approved Inspector."
"The normal way of satisfying Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5) will be to implement a programme of sound insulation testing according to the guidance set out in Section 1: Pre-completion testing, of this Approved Document."
"It is possible for a builder to opt to use design details approved by Robust Details Ltd in some only of the relevant separating structures in a new house or building containing flats, with the other relevant separating structures remaining subject to testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5)."
"However, it is recommended that expert advice is taken to ensure compatibility of the constructions."
"Walls Floors 0.3 The sound insulation testing should be carried out in accordance with the procedure described in Annex B of this Approved Document, which is the procedure formally approved by the Secretary of State for the purpose of paragraph (2)(a) of Regulation 41 and paragraph (2)(a) of Regulation 20(1) and (5)."
"The results of the testing must be recorded in the manner described in paragraph 1.41 of Section 1 of this Approved Document, which is the manner approved by the Secretary of State for the purposes of paragraph (3)(a) of Regulation 41 and paragraph (3)(a) of Regulation 20(1) and (5)."
The test results must be given to the building control body in accordance with the time limits set down in Regulation 41 (for cases where building control is being done by the local authority) or Regulation 20(1) and (5) (in cases where it is being done by an Approved Inspector).
The person carrying out the building work should arrange for sound insulation testing to be carried out by a test body with appropriate third party accreditation.
Test bodies conducting testing should preferably have UKAS accreditation (or a European equivalent) for field measurements.
The DCLG also regards members of the ANC Registration Scheme as suitably qualified to carry out pre-completion testing.
"Sections 2, 3, 4 and 6 of this Approved 0.5 Document give examples of constructions which, if built correctly, should achieve the sound insulation values for dwelling-houses and flats set out in Table 1a, and the values for rooms for residential purposes set out in Table 1b."
"The guidance in these sections is not exhaustive and other designs, materials or products may be used to achieve the required performance."
Buildings constructed from sub-assemblies that are delivered newly made or selected from stock are no different from any other new building and must comply with all requirements in Schedule 1 of the Building Regulations 2010.
"In some applications, such as buildings that are constructed to be temporary dwelling-houses, flats, rooms for residential purposes, or school buildings, the provision of reasonable resistance to the passage of sound may vary depending upon the circumstances in the particular case."
"on the same premises would normally be considered to meet the requirements, (b) a building constructed from sub-assemblies obtained from other premises or from stock manufactured before 1 July 2003 would normally be considered to meet the requirements if it satisfies the relevant requirements of Part E that were applicable in 1992 or, for school buildings, the relevant provisions relating to acoustics set out in the 1997 edition of Building Bulletin 87 (ISBN 011271013 1)."
"In the case of some historic buildings 0.7 undergoing a material change of use, it may not be practical to improve the sound insulation to the standards set out in Tables 1a and 1b."
"The need to conserve the special characteristics of such historic buildings needs to be recognised1, and in such work, the aim should be to improve sound insulation to the extent that it is practically possible, always provided that the work does not prejudice the character of the historic building, or increase the risk of long-term deterioration to the building fabric or fittings."
In arriving at an appropriate balance between historic building conservation and improving sound insulation it would be appropriate to take into account the advice of the local planning authority’s conservation officer.
"In such cases it will be reasonable to improve the sound insulation as much as is practical, and to affix a notice showing the sound insulation value(s) obtained by testing in accordance with Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5), in a conspicuous place inside the building."
"The performance standards set out in Tables 0.8 1a and 1b are appropriate for walls, floors and stairs that separate spaces used for normal domestic purposes."
A higher standard of sound insulation may be required between spaces used for normal domestic purposes and communal or non-domestic purposes.
In these situations the appropriate level of sound insulation will depend on the noise generated in the communal or non-domestic space.
"Specialist advice may be needed to establish if a higher standard of sound insulation is required and, if so, to determine the appropriate level."
"BS 7913 The principles of the conservation of historic buildings, 1998 provides guidance on the principles that should be applied when proposing work on historic buildings."
"Approved Document E Resistance to the passage of soundONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 0.12 In the Secretary of State’s view the normal way of satisfying Requirement E4 will be to meet the values for sound insulation, reverberation time and indoor ambient noise which are given in Building Bulletin 93 Acoustic design of schools: performance standards, published by the Department for Education and available on the internet at www.gov.uk."
Diagrams 0.1 to 0.3 illustrate the relevant parts of the building that should be protected from airborne and impact sound in order to satisfy Requirements E1 and E2.
"In the Secretary of State’s view the normal 0.9 way of satisfying Requirement E2 will be to use constructions for new walls and floors within a dwelling-house, flat or room for residential purposes (including extensions), that provide the laboratory sound insulation values set out in Table 2. Test bodies conducting testing should preferably have UKAS accreditation (or a European equivalent) for laboratory measurements."
It is not intended that performance should be verified by testing on site.
Section 5 gives examples of constructions that should achieve the laboratory values set out in Table 2.
"The guidance in these sections is not exhaustive and other designs, materials or products may be used to achieve the required performance."
"In the Secretary of State’s view the normal 0.11 way of satisfying Requirement E3 will be to apply the sound absorption measures described in Section 7 of this Approved Document, or other measures of similar effectiveness."
"Tests should be carried out once the dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes either side of a separating element are essentially complete, except for decoration."
"Impact sound insulation tests should be carried out without a soft covering (e.g. carpet, foam backed vinyl) on the floor."
For exceptions and further information on floor coverings and testing see Annex B: paragraphs B2.13 and B2.14.
The results of tests only apply to the particular constructions tested but are indicative of the performance of others of the same type in the same development.
"Therefore, in order for meaningful inferences to be made from tests, it is essential that developments are considered as a number of notional groups, with the same construction type within each group."
Grouping should be carried out according to the following criteria.
"Dwelling-houses (including bungalows), flats and rooms for residential purposes should be considered as three separate groups."
"In addition, if significant differences in construction type occur within any of these groups, sub-groups should be established accordingly."
The following guidance should allow suitable sub-grouping in most circumstances.
"For dwelling-houses (including bungalows), sub-grouping should be by type of separating wall."
"For flats, sub-grouping should be by type of separating floor and type of separating wall."
Rooms for residential purposes should be grouped using similar principles.
"The construction of flanking elements (e.g. walls, floors, cavities) and their junctions are also important."
"Where there are significant differences between flanking details, further sub-grouping will be necessary."
"Sub-grouping may not be necessary for dwelling-houses, flats and rooms for residential purposes that have the same separating wall and/or separating floor construction, with the same associated flanking construction(s), and where the room dimensions and layouts are broadly similar."
"Some dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes may be considered to have unfavourable features: an example could be flats with large areas of flanking wall without a window at the gable end."
It would be inappropriate for these to be included as part of a group and these should form their own sub-group(s).
"This section provides guidance on an appropriate programme of sound insulation testing for a sample of properties, under Regulation 41 of the Building Regulations and Regulation 20(1) and (5) of the Approved Inspectors Regulations."
"Sound insulation testing to demonstrate 1.2 compliance with Requirement E1 should be carried out on site as part of the construction process, and in this Approved Document it is referred to as pre-completion testing."
"Under Regulation 41 and Regulation 20(1) and (5), the duty of ensuring that appropriate sound insulation testing is carried out falls on the person carrying out the building work, who is also responsible for the cost of the testing."
"Therefore, the guidance in this section is addressed in the first place to persons carrying out the work (and to testing bodies employed by them)."
"However, it is also addressed to building control bodies, as the Secretary of State expects building control bodies to determine, for each relevant development, the properties selected for testing."
Testing should be carried out for:
purpose built dwelling-houses and flats;
dwelling-houses and flats formed by material change of use;
purpose built rooms for residential purposes;
rooms for residential purposes formed by material change of use.
The normal programme of testing is 1.4 described in paragraphs 1.29 to 1.31.
The testing procedure formally approved by the Secretary of State is described in Annex B: Procedures for sound insulation testing.
The performance standards that should be 1.6 demonstrated by pre-completion testing are set out in Section 0: Performance – Tables 1a and 1b.
"The sound insulation values in these tables have a built-in allowance for measurement uncertainty, so if any test shows one of these values not to have been achieved by any margin, the test has been failed."
"The person carrying out the building work should ensure that the guidance on construction given in this Approved Document, or in another suitable source, is followed properly to minimise the chances of a failed test."
"Where additional guidance is required, specialist advice on the building design should be sought at an early stage."
"Testing should not be carried out between living spaces and: corridors, stairwells or hallways."
Tests should be carried out between rooms 1.9 or spaces that share a common area of separating wall or separating floor.
"The same principles as for new buildings apply, but in practice significant differences are more likely to occur between separating wall and/or separating floor constructions as well as the associated flanking construction(s) in a development."
"More sub-groups may therefore be required, and group sizes may be smaller."
Building control bodies should exercise judgement when setting up sub-groups.
"Normally, one set of tests should comprise two individual sound insulation tests (two airborne tests):"
• A test of insulation against airborne sound between one pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as living rooms) on opposite sides of the separating wall.
• A test of insulation against airborne sound between another pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as bedrooms) on opposite sides of the separating wall.
"Normally, one set of tests should comprise four individual sound insulation tests (two airborne tests, two impact tests):"
• Tests of insulation against both airborne and impact sound between one pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as living rooms) on opposite sides of the separating floor.
• Tests of insulation against both airborne and impact sound between another pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as bedrooms) on opposite sides of the separating floor.
"Normally, one set of tests should comprise six individual sound insulation tests (four airborne tests, two impact tests):"
• A test of insulation against airborne sound between one pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as living rooms) on opposite sides of the separating wall.
• A test of insulation against airborne sound between another pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as bedrooms) on opposite sides of the separating wall.
• Tests of insulation against both airborne and impact sound between one pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as living rooms) on opposite sides of the separating floor.
• Tests of insulation against both airborne and impact sound between another pair of rooms (where possible suitable for use as bedrooms) on opposite sides of the separating floor.
"To conduct a full set of tests, access to at least three flats will be required."
individual tests in bedrooms and living rooms.
"It is preferable that each set of tests contains 1.24 Where pairs of rooms on either side of the separating element are different (e.g. a bedroom and a study, a living room and a bedroom), at least one of the rooms in one of the pairs should be a bedroom and at least one of the rooms in the other pair should be a living room."
"Where the layout has only one pair of rooms on opposite sides of the entire area of separating wall or floor between two dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes then the number of airborne and impact sound insulation tests set out in paragraphs 1.19 to 1.21 may be reduced accordingly."
The approved procedure described in Annex B includes requirements relating to rooms.
"To conduct a set of tests, the sound insulation between the main rooms should be measured according to the principles set out in this section for new buildings and material change of use, but adapting them to suit the circumstances."
"Some properties, for example loft apartments, may be sold before being fitted out with internal walls and other fixtures and fittings."
"Measurements of sound insulation should be made between the available spaces, according to the principles set out in this section."
Steps should be taken to ensure that fitting out will not adversely affect the sound insulation.
Some guidance on internal wall and floor constructions is given in Section 5. Junction details between these internal walls and floors and separating walls and floors are described in Sections 2 and 3.
"Building control bodies should consult with developers on likely completion times on site, and ask for one set of tests to be carried out between the first dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes scheduled for completion and/or sale in each group or sub-group."
This applies regardless of the intended size of the group or sub-group.
"Therefore if a site comprises only one pair of dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes, they should be tested."
"As further properties on a development become ready for testing, building control bodies should indicate at what point(s) they wish any further set(s) of tests to be conducted."
"Assuming no tests are failed, building control bodies should stipulate at least one set of tests for every ten dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes in a group or sub-group."
"Testing should be conducted more frequently at the beginning of a series of completions than towards the end, to allow any potential problems to be addressed at an early stage."
"However, on large developments testing should be carried out over a substantial part of the construction period."
A set of tests is failed if any of its individual tests of airborne or impact sound insulation do not show sound insulation values equal to or better than those set out in Section 0: Performance – Tables 1a and 1b.
"In the event of a failed set of tests, appropriate remedial treatment should be applied to the rooms that failed the test."
"A failed set of tests raises questions over the sound insulation between other rooms sharing the same separating element in the dwelling-houses, flats or rooms for residential purposes in which the tests were conducted."
The developer should demonstrate to the building control body’s satisfaction that these rooms meet the performance standards.
"Normally this would be done by (a) additional testing, and/or (b) applying the appropriate remedial treatment to the other rooms and/or (c) demonstrating that the cause of failure does not occur in other rooms."
A failed set of tests raises questions over properties between which tests have not been carried out.
The developer should demonstrate to the building control body’s satisfaction that such properties meet the performance standards.
"Once a dwelling-house, flat or room for residential purposes is occupied, any action affecting it should be a matter for local negotiation."
"After a failed set of tests, the rate of testing should be increased until the building control body is satisfied that the problem has been solved."
Appropriate remedial treatment should be applied following a failed set of tests.
It is essential that remedial work is appropriate to the cause of failure.
Guidance is available in BRE Information Paper IP 14/02.
"Where the cause of failure is attributed to the construction of the separating and/or associated flanking elements, other rooms that have not been tested may also fail to meet the performance standards."
"Therefore, remedial treatment may be needed in rooms other than those in which the tests were conducted."
"Where remedial treatment has been applied, the building control body should be satisfied with its efficacy."
Normally this will be assessed through additional sound insulation testing.
"As stated in Section 0, in the case of some historic buildings undergoing a material change of use, it may not always be practical to achieve the sound insulation values set out in Section 0: Performance – Tables 1a and 1b."
"However, in such cases building control bodies should be satisfied that everything reasonable has been done to improve the sound insulation."
"Tests should be carried out, and the results displayed as indicated in Section 0, paragraph 0.7."
"paragraph (3)(a) of Regulation 41 or Regulation 20(1) and (5), the test report of a set of tests (where set of tests has the meaning given in paragraphs 1.19–1.21 and 1.27) must contain at least the following information, in the order below:"

"the measured single-number quantity (DnT,w + Ctr for airborne sound insulation and L’nT,w for impact sound insulation) for each test within the set of tests;"
the sound insulation values that should be achieved according to the values set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a or 1b; and

"results of tests shown in tabular and graphical form for third octave bands according to the relevant part of the BS EN ISO 140 series and BS EN ISO 717 series, including:"
single-number quantities and the spectrum adaptation terms;
number quantities are calculated.
"which, if built correctly, should achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a."
"The guidance in this section is not 2.2 exhaustive and other designs, materials or products may be used to achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a. Advice should be sought from the manufacturer or other appropriate source."
The walls are grouped into four main types.
Wall type 1: Solid masonry The resistance to airborne sound depends mainly on the mass per unit area of the wall.
Wall type 2: Cavity masonry The resistance to airborne sound depends on the mass per unit area of the leaves and on the degree of isolation achieved.
The isolation is affected by connections (such as wall ties and foundations) between the wall leaves and by the cavity width.
"Wall type 3: Masonry between independent panels The resistance to airborne sound depends partly on the type and mass per unit area of the core, and partly on the isolation and mass per unit area of the independent panels."
"Wall type 4: Framed walls with absorbent material The resistance to airborne sound depends on the mass per unit area of the leaves, the isolation of the frames, and the absorption in the cavity between the frames."
"Within each wall type the constructions are ranked, as far as possible, with constructions providing higher sound insulation given first."
"effective, care should be taken to correctly detail the junctions between the separating wall and other elements, such as floors, roofs, external walls and internal walls."
"Recommendations are also given for the construction of these elements, where it is necessary to control flanking transmission."
Notes and diagrams explain the junction details for each of the separating wall types.
Table 2.1 indicates the inclusion of guidance in this document on the junctions that may occur between each of the four separating wall types and various attached building elements.
For flats the following may also apply:
Separating floor type 2 – concrete base with ceiling and floating floor
Separating floor type 3 – timber frame base with ceiling and platform floor
Where any building element functions as a separating element (e.g. a ground floor that is also a separating floor for a basement flat) then the separating element requirements should take precedence.
The mass per unit area of a wall is expressed in kilograms per square metre (kg/m2).
The method for calculating mass per unit area is shown in Annex A.
The density of the materials used (and on which the mass per unit area of the wall depends) is expressed in kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m³).
"When calculating the mass per unit area for bricks and blocks use the density at the appropriate moisture content from Table 3.2, CIBSE Guide A (1999)."
The guidance describes constructions that use blocks without voids.
"For blocks with voids, seek advice from the manufacturer."
The guidance describes some constructions with only wet finishes.
"For dry finishes, seek advice from the manufacturer."
"Wherever plasterboard is recommended, or the finish is not specified, a drylining laminate of plasterboard with mineral wool may be used."
"For other drylining laminates, seek advice from the manufacturer."
Plasterboard linings should be fixed according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Recommended cavity widths are minimum values.
Suitable wall ties for use in masonry cavity walls are indicated in the guidance by reference to either tie type A or B.
"Connect the leaves of a cavity masonry wall only where necessary by butterfly ties as described in BS 1243:1978 Metal ties for cavity wall construction, and spaced as required for structural purposes (BS 5628-3:2001 Code of practice for use of masonry."
"Materials and components, design and workmanship, which limits this tie type and spacing to cavity widths of 50mm to 75mm with a minimum masonry leaf thickness of 90mm)."
"Alternatively, use wall ties with an appropriate measured dynamic stiffness for the cavity width."
"The specification for wall ties of dynamic stiffness, kXmm in MN/m with a cavity width of Xmm and n ties/m² is n.kXmm<4.8MN/m³."
"Connect the leaves of a cavity masonry wall only where necessary by double-triangle ties as described in BS 1243:1978 Metal ties for cavity wall construction, and spaced as required for structural purposes (BS 5628-3:2001 Code of practice for use of masonry."
"Materials and components, design and workmanship, which limits this tie type and spacing to cavity widths of 50mm to 75mm with a minimum masonry leaf thickness of 90mm)."
"Alternatively, use wall ties with an appropriate measured dynamic stiffness for the cavity width."
"The specification for wall ties of dynamic stiffness, kXmm in MN/m with a cavity width of Xmm and n ties/m² is n.kXmm<113MN/m³."
"Note: In external cavity masonry walls, tie type B may decrease the airborne sound insulation due to flanking transmission via the external wall leaf compared to tie type A."
"Measurements of the wall tie dynamic stiffness, kXmm, should be carried out according to BRE Information Paper, IP 3/01."
"The number of ties per square metre, n, is calculated from the horizontal and vertical tie spacing distances, Sx and Sy in metres using n = 1 / (Sx.Sy)."
"Example: for horizontal and vertical tie spacing distances of 0.9m and 0.45m, n is 2.5 ties/m²."
"If kXmm is not available for the required 2.23 cavity width, it is acceptable to use available kXmm data for Xmm values less than the required cavity width to calculate n.kXmm."
All wall ties and spacings specified using the dynamic stiffness parameter should also satisfy the Requirements of Building Regulation Part A – Structure.
"The separating walls described in this section should be used between corridors and rooms in flats, in order to control flanking transmission and to provide the required sound insulation."
"However, it is likely that the sound insulation will be reduced by the presence of a door."
(measured according to BS EN ISO 140-3:1995 and rated according to BS EN ISO 717-1:1997).
The door should also satisfy the Requirements of Building Regulation Part B – Fire safety.
"Noisy parts of the building should preferably have a lobby, double door or high performance doorset to contain the noise."
"Where this is not possible, nearby flats should have similar protection."
"However, there should be a sufficient number of flats that are suitable for disabled access, see Building Regulation Part M – Access and facilities for disabled people."
A wall separating a habitable room or kitchen and a refuse chute should have a mass per unit area (including any finishes) of at least 1320kg/m².
A wall separating a non-habitable room from a refuse chute should have a mass per unit area (including any finishes) of at least 220kg/m².
The resistance to airborne sound depends mainly on the mass per unit area of the wall.
"Three wall type 1 constructions (types 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) are described in this guidance."
Details of how junctions should be made to limit flanking transmission are also described in this guidance.
Do fill and seal all masonry joints with mortar.
Do lay bricks frog up to achieve the required mass per unit area and avoid air paths.
Do use bricks/blocks that extend to the full thickness of the wall.
"Do ensure that an external cavity wall is stopped with a flexible closer at the junction with a separating wall, unless the cavity is fully filled with mineral wool or expanded polystyrene beads (seek manufacturer’s advice for other suitable materials)."
Do control flanking transmission from walls and floors connected to the separating wall as described in the guidance on junctions.
Do stagger the position of sockets on opposite sides of the separating wall.
Do ensure that flue blocks will not adversely affect the sound insulation and that a suitable finish is used over the flue blocks (see BS 1289– 1:1986 and seek manufacturer’s advice).
Do not try and convert a cavity separating wall to a type 1 (solid masonry) separating wall by inserting mortar or concrete into the cavity between the two leaves.
"Do not use deep sockets and chases in the separating wall, and do not place sockets back to back."
Do not create a junction between a solid wall type 1 and a cavity wall type 2 in which the cavity wall is bridged by the solid wall.

The separating wall should be joined to the inner leaf of the external cavity wall by one of the following methods:
The separating wall should be bonded to the external wall in such a way that the separating wall contributes at least 50% of the bond at the junction.
The external wall should abut the separating wall and be tied to it.
"Also, see Building Regulation Part A – Structure."
The masonry inner leaf should have a mass per unit area of at least 120kg/m² excluding finish.
"However, there is no minimum mass requirement where there are openings in the external wall (see Diagram 2.8) that are:"

If the floor joists are to be supported on a 2.49 type 1 separating wall then they should be supported on hangers and should not be built in.
"See Building Regulation Part C – Site preparation and resistance to moisture, and Building Regulation Part L – Conservation of fuel and power."
"The ground floor may be a solid slab, laid on the ground, or a suspended concrete floor."
A concrete slab floor on the ground may be continuous under a type 1 separating wall.
A suspended concrete floor may only pass under a type 1 separating wall if the floor has a mass of at least 365kg/m².
Hollow core concrete plank and concrete beams with infilling block floors should not be continuous under a type 1 separating wall.
No guidance available (seek specialist advice).
There are no restrictions on internal framed walls meeting a type 1 separating wall.
Internal masonry walls that abut a type 1 2.44 separating wall should have a mass per unit area of at least 120kg/m² excluding finish.
If the floor joists are to be supported on 2.45 a type 1 separating wall then they should be supported on hangers and should not be built in.

"See Building Regulation Part C – Site preparation and resistance to moisture, and Building Regulation Part L – Conservation of fuel and power."
Where a type 1 separating wall is used it should be continuous to the underside of the roof.
The junction between the separating wall and the roof should be filled with a flexible closer which is also suitable as a fire stop.
"Where the roof or loft space is not a habitable room and there is a ceiling with a minimum mass per unit area of 10kg/m² with sealed joints, then the mass per unit area of the separating wall above the ceiling may be reduced to 150kg/m²."
"If lightweight aggregate blocks of density 2.58 less than 1200kg/m³ are used above ceiling level, then one side should be sealed with cement paint or plaster skim."
"Where there is an external cavity wall, the cavity should be closed at eaves level with a suitable flexible material (e.g. mineral wool)."
Note: A rigid connection between the inner and external wall leaves should be avoided.
"If a rigid material is used, then it should only be rigidly bonded to one leaf."
"See BRE BR 262, Thermal Insulation: avoiding risks, Section 2.3."
There are important details in Section 3 concerning junctions between wall type 1 and separating floors.
The resistance to airborne sound depends on the mass per unit area of the leaves and on the degree of isolation achieved.
The isolation is affected by connections (such as wall ties and foundations) between the wall leaves and by the cavity width.
"Four wall type 2 constructions (types 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4) are described in this guidance."
Two of these wall constructions (types 2.3 and 2.4) are only suitable when a step in elevation and/or a stagger in plan is incorporated at the separating wall.
Details of how junctions should be made to limit flanking transmission are also described in this guidance.
Points to watch:
The wall ties used to connect the leaves of a cavity masonry wall should be tie type A.
Recommended cavity widths are minimum values.
The guidance describes constructions that use blocks without voids.
"For blocks with voids, seek advice from the manufacturer."
• minimum mass per unit area including plaster 415kg/m²;
• minimum cavity width of 50mm;
• 13mm plaster on both room faces.
This is an example only.
See Annex A for a simplified method of calculating mass per unit area.
Alternatively use manufacturer’s actual figures where these are available.
Do fill and seal all masonry joints with mortar.
Do keep the cavity leaves separate below ground floor level.
"Do ensure that any external cavity wall is stopped with a flexible closer at the junction with the separating wall, unless the cavity is fully filled with mineral wool or expanded polystyrene beads (seek manufacturer’s advice for other suitable materials)."

Do stagger the position of sockets on opposite sides of the separating wall.
Do ensure that flue blocks will not adversely affect the sound insulation and that a suitable finish is used over the flue blocks (see BS 1289-1:1986 and seek manufacturer’s advice).
Do not try and convert a cavity separating wall to a type 1 (solid masonry) separating wall by inserting mortar or concrete into the cavity between the two leaves.
Do not change to a solid wall construction in the roof space as a rigid connection between the leaves will reduce wall performance.
Do not build cavity walls off a continuous solid concrete slab floor.
"Do not use deep sockets and chases in the separating wall, do not place them back to back."
Additional construction: wall type 2.3 should only be used where there is a step and/or stagger of at least 300mm.

• minimum cavity width of 75mm;
• 13mm plaster on both room faces.
This is an example only.

• lightweight aggregate blocks should have a density in the range 1350 to 1600kg/m³;
• minimum cavity width of 75mm;
"• plasterboard, each sheet of minimum mass per unit area 10kg/m², on both room faces."
Note: The composition of the lightweight aggregate blocks contributes to the performance of this construction with a plasterboard finish.
Using denser blocks may not give an equivalent performance.
This is an example only.
See Annex A for a simplified method of calculating mass per unit area.
Alternatively use manufacturer’s actual figures where these are available.
Note: Increasing the size of the step or stagger in the separating wall tends to increase the airborne sound insulation.

• minimum mass per unit area including finish 150kg/m²;
• minimum cavity width of 75mm;
"• plasterboard, each sheet of minimum mass per unit area 10kg/m², on both room faces; or"
• 13mm plaster on both room faces.

"However, there is no minimum mass requirement where separating wall type 2.1, 2.3 or 2.4 is used."
"Where there is also a separating floor then the requirement for a minimum mass per unit area of 120kg/m² excluding finish should always apply, even when wall type 2.1, 2.3 or 2.4 is used."
Where the external wall is a cavity wall:
the outer leaf of the wall may be of any construction; and
the cavity should be stopped with a flexible closer.
"Where the inner leaf of an external cavity wall is of framed construction, the framed inner leaf should:"
abut the separating wall; and
be tied to it with ties at no more than 300mm centres vertically.

one layer of plasterboard; or
two layers of plasterboard where there is a separating floor;

"Where there is an external cavity wall, the cavity should be closed at eaves level with a suitable flexible material (e.g. mineral wool)."
Note: A rigid connection between the inner and external wall leaves should be avoided.
"If a rigid material is used, then it should only be rigidly bonded to one leaf."
"The resistance to airborne sound depends partly on the type and mass per unit area of the core, and partly on the isolation and mass per unit area of the independent panels."
Note: Wall type 3 can give high resistance to the transmission of both airborne sound and impact sound on the wall.
"Three wall type 3 constructions (types 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) are described in this guidance."

"types which, if built correctly, should achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a."
"The guidance in this section is not 3.2 exhaustive and other designs, materials or products may be used to achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a. Advice should be sought from the manufacturer or other appropriate source."
The floors are grouped into three main 3.3 types.
The resistance to airborne sound depends mainly on the mass per unit area of the concrete base and partly on the mass per unit area of the ceiling.
The soft floor covering reduces impact sound at source.
Floor type 2: Concrete base with ceiling 3.5 and floating floor
"The resistance to airborne and impact sound depends on the mass per unit area of the concrete base, as well as the mass per unit area and isolation of the floating layer and the ceiling."
The floating floor reduces impact sound at source.
Floor type 2: Floating floor
Floor type 2 requires one of the floating floors described in this section.
"The description of floor type 2 contains a suffix (a), (b) or (c) which refers to the floating floor used."
Floor type 3: Timber frame base with 3.7 ceiling and platform floor
The resistance to airborne and impact sound depends on the structural floor base and the isolation of the platform floor and the ceiling.
The platform floor reduces impact sound at source.
Each floor type requires one of the ceiling treatments described in this section.
"The description of each floor type contains a suffix A, B or C that refers to the ceiling treatment used."
"Within each floor type the constructions are ranked, as far as possible, with constructions providing better sound insulation given first."
"fully effective, care should be taken to correctly detail the junctions between the separating floor and other elements such as external walls, separating walls and floor penetrations."
Recommendations are also given for the construction of these other elements where it is necessary to control flanking transmission.
Notes and diagrams explain the junction details for each of the separating floor types.
Diagram 3.1 Types of separating floor
Table 3.1 indicates the inclusion of guidance in this document on the junctions that may occur between each of the separating floor types and various attached building elements.
For flats the following may also apply:
Where any building element functions as a separating element (e.g. a ground floor that is also a separating floor for a basement flat) then the separating element requirements should take precedence.
Ceiling treatment A should meet the following specification:
• at least 2 layers of plasterboard with staggered joints;
• minimum total mass per unit area of plasterboard 20kg/m²;
"• an absorbent layer of mineral wool (minimum thickness 100mm, minimum density 10kg/m³) laid in the cavity formed above the ceiling."
The ceiling should be supported by one of the following methods:
"• Floor types 1, 2 and 3. Use independent joists fixed only to the surrounding walls."
A clearance of at least 100mm should be left between the top of the plasterboard forming the ceiling and the underside of the base floor.
• Floor type 3. Use independent joists fixed to the surrounding walls with additional support provided by resilient hangers attached directly to the floor.
A clearance of at least 100mm should be left between the top of the ceiling joists and the underside of the base floor.
"For beam and block separating floors, seek advice from the manufacturer."
The mass per unit area of a floor is expressed in kilograms per square metre (kg/m²).
The mass per unit area of floors should be obtained from manufacturer’s data or calculated using the method shown in Annex A.
The density of the materials used (and on which the mass per unit area of the floor depends) is expressed in kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m³).
"Where appropriate, the mass per unit area of a bonded screed may be included in the calculation of the mass per unit area of the floor."
The mass per unit area of a floating screed should not be included in the calculation of the mass per unit area of the floor.
"Each floor type should use one of the following three ceiling treatments (A, B or C)."
"The ceiling treatments are ranked, in order of sound insulation performance from A to C, with constructions providing higher sound insulation given first."
Note: Use of a better performing ceiling than that described in the guidance should improve the sound insulation of the floor provided there is no significant flanking transmission.
The resistance to airborne sound depends mainly on the mass per unit area of the concrete base and partly on the mass per unit area of the ceiling.
The soft floor covering reduces impact sound at source.
The construction consists of a concrete floor base with a soft floor covering and a ceiling.
Two floor type 1 constructions (types 1.1C and 1.2B) are described in this guidance which should be combined with the appropriate ceiling and soft floor covering.
Details of how junctions should be made to limit flanking transmission are also described in this guidance.
Points to watch:
Do seal the perimeter of the independent ceiling with tape or sealant.
Do not create a rigid or direct connection between the independent ceiling and the floor base.
Ceiling treatment B should meet the following specification:
"• single layer of plasterboard, minimum mass per unit area of plasterboard 10kg/m²;"
• fixed using proprietary resilient metal bars.
"On concrete floors, these resilient metal bars should be fixed to timber battens."
"For fixing details, seek advice from the manufacturer;"
• an absorbent layer of mineral wool (minimum density 10kg/m³) that fills the ceiling void.
Ceiling treatment C should meet the following specification:
"• single layer of plasterboard, minimum mass per unit area 10kg/m2;"
• • fixed using timber battens or proprietary resilient channels;
"if resilient channels are used, incorporate an absorbent layer of mineral wool minimum density 10kg/m³) that fills the ceiling void."
Note: Electrical cables give off heat when in use and special precautions may be required when they are covered by thermally insulating materials.
"See BRE BR 262, Thermal Insulation: avoiding risks, section 2.4."
Installing recessed light fittings in ceiling treatments A to C can reduce their resistance to the passage of airborne and impact sound.
Do fix or glue the soft floor covering to the floor.
Do fill all joints between parts of the floor to avoid air paths.
Do give special attention to workmanship and detailing at the perimeter and wherever a pipe or duct penetrates the floor in order to reduce flanking transmission and to avoid air paths.
Do build a separating concrete floor into the walls around its entire perimeter where the walls are masonry.
Do fill with mortar any gap that may form between the head of a masonry wall and the underside of the concrete floor.
Do control flanking transmission from walls connected to the separating floor as described in the guidance on junctions.
Do not allow the floor base to bridge a cavity in a cavity masonry wall.
Do not use non-resilient floor finishes that are rigidly connected to the floor base.
The soft floor covering should meet the following specification:
"• any resilient material, or material with a resilient base, with an overall uncompressed thickness of at least 4.5mm; or"
• any floor covering with a weighted reduction in impact sound pressure level (DLw) of not less than 17dB when measured in accordance with BS EN ISO 140-8:1998 and calculated in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-2:1997.

The resilient layer specification is:
"• mineral wool, minimum thickness 25mm, density 60 to 100kg/m³;"

In all cases it may be necessary to control 4.10 flanking transmission in order to achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a. See Section 4: Junction requirements for material change of use.
Special attention needs to be given to situations where flanking walls or floors are continuous across separating walls or floors as a result of the conversion work.
In such instances additional treatments may be required to control flanking transmission along these continuous elements.
Specialist advice may be needed.
Significant differences may frequently occur between the construction and layout of each converted unit in a development.
Building control bodies should have regard to the guidance in Section 1 when deciding on the application of pre-completion testing to material change of use.
"For some historic buildings undergoing a material change of use, it may not be practical to improve the sound insulation to the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a."
"In such cases refer to Section 0: Performance, paragraph 0.7."
Wall and floor treatments will impose additional loads on the existing structure.
"The structure should be assessed to ensure that the additional loading can be carried safely, with appropriate strengthening applied where necessary."
"Floor or wall penetrations, such as ducts or pipes, passing through separating elements in conversions can reduce the level of sound insulation."
Guidance on the treatment of floor penetrations is given below.
houses and flats formed by material change of use.
For rooms for residential purposes formed by material change of use see Section 6.
"It may be that an existing wall, floor or stair 4.2 in a building that is to undergo a material change of use will achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a without the need for remedial work."
"This would be the case if the construction was generally similar (including flanking constructions) to one of the constructions in Sections 2 and 3 (e.g. concerning the mass requirement, the structure under consideration should be within 15% of the mass per unit area of a construction listed in the relevant section)."
In other circumstances it may be possible 4.3 to use the guidance in Section 2 or 3 (including flanking constructions) to determine the appropriate remedial treatment which will result in the construction achieving the performance standards in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a.
"For situations where it is uncertain whether 4.4 the existing construction achieves the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a, this section describes one wall treatment, two floor treatments and one stair treatment as shown in Diagram 4.1."
These constructions can be used to increase the sound insulation.
"The guidance in this section is not exhaustive and other designs, materials or products may be used to achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a. Advice should be sought from the manufacturer or other appropriate source."
"The resistance to airborne sound depends on the form of existing construction, the mass of the independent panel(s), the isolation of the panel(s) and the absorbent material."
"The resistance to airborne and impact sound depends on the combined mass of the existing floor and the independent ceiling, the absorbent material, the isolation of the independent ceiling and the airtightness of the whole construction."
"The resistance to airborne and impact sound depends on the total mass of the floor, the effectiveness of the resilient layer and the absorbent material."
Before a floor treatment is applied appropriate remedial work to the existing construction should be undertaken as described in paragraphs 4.17 and 4.18.
If the existing floor is timber then gaps in 4.17 floor boarding should be sealed by overlaying with hardboard or filled with sealant.
"Where floor boards are to be replaced, boarding should have a minimum thickness of 12mm, and mineral wool (minimum thickness 100mm, minimum density 10kg/m³) should be laid between the joists in the floor cavity."
"If the existing floor is concrete and the mass per unit area of the concrete floor is less than 300kg/m², or is unknown, then the mass of the floor should be increased to at least 300kg/m²."
Any air gaps through a concrete floor should be sealed.
A regulating screed may also be required.
If there is an existing lath and plaster ceiling it should be retained as long as it satisfies Building Regulation Part B – Fire safety.
"Where the existing ceiling is not lath and plaster it should be upgraded as necessary to provide at least two layers of plasterboard with joints staggered, total mass per unit area 20kg/m²."
Extensive remedial work to reduce flanking transmission may also be necessary to achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1a.
"This may involve wall linings, see Section 4: Junction requirements for material change of use, paragraphs 4.43 and 4.44."
"The separating walls described in this section should be used between dwelling-houses, or flats formed by material change of use, and corridors in order to control flanking transmission and to provide the required sound insulation."
"However, it is likely that the sound insulation will be reduced by the presence of a door."
Ensure that any door has good perimeter sealing (including the threshold where practical) and a minimum mass per unit area of 25kg/m² or a minimum sound reduction index of 29dB Rw (measured according to BS EN ISO 140-3:1995 and rated according to BS EN ISO 717-1:1997).
The door should also satisfy the Requirements of Building Regulation Part B – Fire safety.
"Noisy parts of the building should preferably have a lobby, double door or high performance doorset to contain the noise."
"Where this is not possible, nearby flats should have similar protection."
"However, there should be a sufficient number of them that are suitable for disabled access, see Building Regulations Part M – Access and facilities for disabled people."
"The resistance to airborne sound depends on the form of existing construction, the mass of independent panel(s), the isolation of the panel(s) and the absorbent material."
"The independent panel may be used on one side of the existing wall only where the existing wall is masonry, and has a thickness of at least 100mm and is plastered on both faces."
With other types of existing wall the independent panels should be built on both sides.
• minimum mass per unit area of panel (excluding any supporting framework) 20kg/m²;
• each panel should consist of at least two layers of plasterboard with staggered joints;
• • if the panels are free-standing they should be at least 35mm from masonry core;
if the panels are supported on a frame there should be a gap of at least 10mm between the frame and the face of the existing wall;
"• mineral wool, minimum density 10kg/m³ and minimum thickness 35mm, in the cavity between the panel and the existing wall."
Points to watch:
Do ensure that the independent panel and its supporting frame are not in contact with the existing wall.
Do seal the perimeter of the independent panel with tape or sealant.
Do not tightly compress the absorbent material as this may bridge the cavity.
Do not create a rigid or direct connection between the independent ceiling and the floor base.
Do not tightly compress the absorbent material as this may bridge the cavity.
"The resistance to airborne and impact sound depends on the combined mass of the existing floor and the independent ceiling, the absorbent material, the isolation of the independent ceiling and the airtightness of the whole construction."
"• at least 2 layers of plasterboard with staggered joints, minimum total mass per unit area 20kg/m²;"
"• an absorbent layer of mineral wool laid on the ceiling, minimum thickness 100mm, minimum density 10kg/m³."
The ceiling should be supported by one of the following methods:
• • independent joists fixed only to the surrounding walls.
A clearance of at least 25mm should be left between the top of the independent ceiling joists and the underside of the existing floor construction; or
independent joists fixed to the surrounding walls with additional support provided by resilient hangers attached directly to the existing floor base.
Note: This construction involves a separation of at least 125mm between the upper surface of the independent ceiling and the underside of the existing floor construction.
"However, structural considerations determining the size of ceiling joists will often result in greater separation."
Care should be taken at the design stage to ensure that adequate ceiling height is available in all rooms to be treated.
"Where a window head is near to the existing ceiling, the new independent ceiling may be raised to form a pelmet recess."
"For the junction detail between floor treatment 1 and wall treatment 1, see Diagram 4.5."
Points to watch:
Do remember to apply appropriate remedial work to the existing construction.
Do seal the perimeter of the independent ceiling with tape or sealant.
"The resistance to airborne and impact sound depends on the total mass of the floor, the effectiveness of the resilient layer and the absorbent material."
"Where this treatment is used to improve an existing timber floor, a layer of mineral wool (minimum thickness 100mm, minimum density 10kg/m³) should be laid between the joists in the floor cavity."
The floating layer should be:
• a minimum of two layers of board material;
• minimum total mass per unit area 25kg/m²;
• each layer of minimum thickness 8mm;
screwed) with joints staggered.
The floating layer should be laid loose on a resilient layer.
The resilient layer specification is:
"• mineral wool, minimum thickness 25mm, density 60 to 100kg/m³;"
• the mineral wool may be paper faced on the underside.
Note: The lower figure of density for the resilient layer gives the best insulation but a ‘softer’ floor.
In such cases additional support can be provided around the perimeter of the floor by using a timber batten with a foam strip along the top attached to the wall.
"For the junction detail between floor treatment 2 and wall treatment 1, see Diagram 4.7."
Points to watch:
Do remember to apply appropriate remedial work to the existing construction.
Do use the correct density of resilient layer and ensure it can carry the anticipated load.
Do allow for movement of materials e.g. expansion of chipboard after laying (to maintain isolation).
Do carry the resilient layer up at all room edges to isolate the floating layer from the wall surface.
Do leave a small gap (approx.
5mm) between skirting and floating layer and fill with a flexible sealant.
Do lay resilient materials in sheets with joints tightly butted and taped.
Do seal the perimeter of any new ceiling with tape or sealant.
Do not bridge between the floating layer and the base or surrounding walls (e.g. with services or fixings that penetrate the resilient layer).
Where there is no cupboard under the stair construct an independent ceiling below the stair (see Floor treatment 1).
For fire protection where a staircase performs a separating function refer to Building Regulation Part B – Fire safety.
Stairs are subject to the same sound insulation requirements as floors where they perform a separating function.
"The resistance to airborne sound depends mainly on the mass of the stair, the mass and isolation of any independent ceiling and the airtightness of any cupboard or enclosure under the stairs."
The stair covering reduces impact sound at source.
"For floating floors, carry the resilient layer up at all room edges to isolate the floating layer from the wall surface."
"For floating floors, leave a small gap (approx."
5mm) between the skirting and floating layer and fill with a flexible sealant.
The perimeter of any new ceiling should be sealed with tape or caulked with sealant.
Relevant junction details are shown in Diagrams 4.5 and 4.7.
Lay soft covering of at least 6mm thickness over the stair treads.
Ensure it is securely fixed (e.g. glued) so it does not become a safety hazard.
"If there is a cupboard under all, or part, of the stair:"
"line the underside of the stair within the cupboard with plasterboard of minimum mass per unit area 10kg/m² and an absorbent layer of mineral wool (minimum density 10kg/m³), within the space above the lining; and"
"build cupboard walls from two layers of plasterboard (or equivalent), each sheet of minimum mass per unit area 10kg/m²; and"
"use a small, heavy, well fitted door for the cupboard."
an independent layer of plasterboard; or
a laminate of plasterboard and mineral wool.
"For other drylining laminates, seek advice from the manufacturer."
"Where the adjoining masonry wall has a mass per unit area greater than 375kg/m² then such lining may not be necessary, as it may not give a significant improvement."
Note: Specialist advice may be needed on the diagnosis and control of flanking transmission.
Piped services (excluding gas pipes) and ducts which pass through separating floors in conversions should be surrounded with sound absorbent material for their full height and enclosed in a duct above and below the floor.
Do seal the joint between casings and ceiling with tape or sealant.
Do leave a nominal gap (approx.
5mm) between the casing and any floating layer and fill with sealant.
Pipes and ducts that penetrate a floor separating habitable rooms in different flats should be enclosed for their full height in each flat.
The enclosure should be constructed of material having a mass per unit area of at least 15kg/m².
"Either line the enclosure, or wrap the duct or pipe within the enclosure, with 25mm unfaced mineral wool."
The enclosure may go down to the floor base if floor treatment 2 is used but ensure isolation from the floating layer.
Penetrations through a separating floor by ducts and pipes should have fire protection to satisfy Building Regulation Part B – Fire safety.
Fire stopping should be flexible and also prevent rigid contact between the pipe and floor.
Note: There are requirements for ventilation of ducts at each floor where they contain gas pipes.
Gas pipes may be contained in a separate ventilated duct or they can remain unducted.
"Where a gas service is installed, it shall comply with relevant codes and standards to ensure safe and satisfactory operation."
"See The Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998, SI 1998/2451."
and floor constructions that meet the laboratory sound insulation values set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 2.
"sound insulation of the internal floor will not be achieved; nevertheless, the internal floor should still satisfy Requirement E2."
It is good practice to consider the layout of 5.12 rooms at the design stage to avoid placing noise sensitive rooms next to rooms in which noise is generated.
Guidance on layout is provided in BS 8233:1999 Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings.

"• each lining to be two or more layers of plasterboard, each sheet of minimum mass per unit area 10kg/m²;"
"• linings fixed to timber frame with a minimum distance between linings of 75mm, or metal frame with a minimum distance between linings of 45mm;"
• all joints well sealed.
These constructions have been designed to 5.2 give insulation against airborne sound.
"For internal floors, insulation against impact sound could be improved by adding a soft covering (e.g. carpet)."
They are grouped in four main types as 5.3 shown below.
"The resistance to airborne sound depends on the mass per unit area of the leaves, the cavity width, frame material and the absorption in the cavity between the leaves."
The resistance to airborne sound depends mainly on the mass per unit area of the wall.
The resistance to airborne sound depends on the mass per unit area of the concrete base or concrete beams and infilling blocks.
A soft covering will reduce impact sound at source.
"The resistance to airborne sound depends on the structural floor base, the ceiling and the absorbent material."
A soft covering will reduce impact sound at source.
"For both internal walls and internal floors 5.8 the constructions are ranked, as far as possible, with constructions giving better sound insulation given first."
sealing provide a lower standard of sound insulation than walls.
This will reduce the effective sound insulation of the internal wall.
Ways of improving sound insulation include ensuring that there is good perimeter sealing or by using a doorset.
See Building Regulation Part F – Ventilation and Part J – Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems.

See guidance in Section 2;
"internal wall type D should not be used as a load-bearing wall connected to a separating floor, or be rigidly connected to the separating floors described in this Approved Document."
See guidance in Section 3.
Note: Insulation against impact sounds can be improved by adding a soft covering (e.g. carpet).

Rooms for residential purposes are defined in Regulation 2 of the Building Regulations 2010.
This definition is reproduced after the Requirements in this Approved Document.
"This Section gives examples of wall and 6.2 floor types, which, if built correctly, should meet the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1b."
"The guidance in this section is not 6.3 exhaustive and other designs, materials or products may be used to achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1b."
Advice should be sought from the manufacturer or other appropriate source.
Of the separating walls described in Section 2 the following types are most suitable for use in new buildings containing rooms for residential purposes:
"• Wall type 1.1, Dense aggregate concrete block, plaster on both room faces;"
"• Wall type 1.2, Dense aggregate concrete in situ, plaster on both room faces;"
"• Wall type 1.3, Brick, plaster on both room faces."
"Note: Plasterboard may be used as an alternative wall finish, provided a sheet of minimum mass per unit area 10kg/m² is used on each room face."
"• Wall type 3.1, Solid masonry core (dense aggregate concrete block), independent panels on both room faces."
"• Wall type 3.2, Solid masonry core (lightweight concrete block), independent panels on both room faces."
Note: Wall types 2 and 4 can be used provided that care is taken to maintain isolation between the leaves.
Specialist advice may be needed.
Separating walls described in 6.4 should be used between rooms for residential purposes and corridors in order to control flanking transmission and to provide the required sound insulation between the dwelling and the corridor.
"However, it is likely that the sound insulation will be reduced by the presence of a door."
Ensure any door has good perimeter 6.6 sealing (including the threshold where practical) and a minimum mass per unit area of 25kg/m².
"Alternatively, use a doorset with a minimum sound reduction index of 29dB Rw (measured in the laboratory according to BS EN ISO 140-3:1995 and rated according to BS EN ISO 717-1:1997)."
The door should also satisfy the Requirements of Building Regulation Part B – Fire safety.
"Noisy parts of the building (e.g. function rooms or bars) should preferably have a lobby, double door or high performance doorset to contain the noise."
"Where this is not possible, nearby rooms for residential purposes should have similar protection."
"However, do ensure that there are doors that are suitable fordisabled access, see Building Regulations Part M – Access and facilities for disabled people."
Of the separating floors described in Section 3 the following types are most suitable for use in new buildings containing rooms for residential purposes:
"• Floor type 1.1C Solid concrete slab (cast in situ, with or without permanent shuttering), soft floor covering, ceiling treatment C."
"• Floor type 1.2B Concrete planks (solid or hollow), soft floor covering, ceiling treatment B."
Note: Floor types 2 and 3 can be used provided that floating floors and ceilings are not continuous between rooms for residential purposes.
Specialist advice may be needed.
"It may be that an existing wall, floor or stair in a building that is to undergo a material change of use will achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1b without the need for remedial work."
This would be the case if the construction was similar (including flanking constructions) to one of the constructions in paragraphs 6.4 and 6.8 (e.g. for solid walls and floors the mass requirement should be within 15% of the mass per unit area of a construction listed in the relevant section).
"For situations where it cannot be shown that the existing construction will achieve the performance standards set out in Section 0: Performance – Table 1b, Section 4 describes wall, floor and stair treatments to improve the level of sound insulation in dwellings formed by material change of use."
These treatments may be used in buildings containing rooms for residential purposes.
Specialist advice may be needed.
"effective, care should be taken to detail correctly the junctions between the separating wall and other elements, such as floors, roofs, external walls and internal walls."
"In the case of new buildings containing 6.12 rooms for residential purposes, refer to the guidance in Sections 2 and 3 which describes the junction and flanking details for each of the new build separating wall and floor types."
"When rooms for residential purposes are formed by material change of use, refer to the notes and diagrams in Section 4 that describe the junction and flanking details for the wall and floor treatments."
"In the case of the junction between a solid 6.14 masonry separating wall type 1 and the ceiling void and roof space, the solid wall need not be continuous to the underside of the structural floor or roof provided that:"
"there is a ceiling consisting of two or more layers of plasterboard, of minimum total mass per unit area 20kg/m²;"
"there is a layer of mineral wool (minimum thickness 200mm, minimum density 10kg/m³) in the roof void;"
the ceiling is not perforated.
The ceiling joists and plasterboard sheets should not be continuous between rooms for residential purposes.
This ceiling void and roof space detail can only be used where the Requirements of Building Regulations Part B – Fire safety can also be satisfied.
The Requirements of Building Regulations Part L – Conservation of fuel and power should also be satisfied.
"layout, building services and sound insulation."
Internal noise levels are affected by room 6.17 The layout of rooms should be considered at the design stage to avoid placing noise sensitive rooms next to rooms in which noise is generated.
Additional guidance is provided in BS 8233:1999 Sound insulation and noise reduction for buildings.

See Annex D: References.
"This Section describes how to determine the amount of additional absorption to be used in corridors, hallways, stairwells and entrance halls that give access to flats and rooms for residential purposes."
"For the purposes of this Section, a corridor 7.2 or hallway is a space for which the ratio of the longest to the shortest floor dimension is greater than three."
"For the purposes of this Section, an entrance 7.3 hall is a space for which the ratio of the longest to the shortest floor dimension is three or less."
"When an entrance hall, corridor, hallway or stairwell opens directly into another of these spaces, the guidance should be followed for each space individually."
The choice of absorptive material should 7.5 meet the Requirements of Building Regulation Part B – Fire safety.
"Two methods are described to satisfy 7.6 Requirement E3, Method A and Method B."
Method A: Cover a specified area with an absorber of an appropriate class that has been rated according to BS EN ISO 11654:1997 Acoustics.
Sound absorbers for use in buildings.
Rating of sound absorption.
Method B: Determine the minimum amount of absorptive material using a calculation procedure in octave bands.
"Method B is intended only for corridors, hallways and entrance halls as it is not well suited to stairwells."
"For entrance halls, corridors or hallways, cover an area equal to or greater than the floor area, with a Class C absorber or better."
It will normally be convenient to cover the ceiling area with the additional absorption.
"For stairwells or a stair enclosure, calculate the combined area of the stair treads, the upper surface of the intermediate landings, the upper surface of the landings (excluding ground floor) and the ceiling area on the top floor."
"Either cover at least an area equal to this calculated area with a Class D absorber, or cover an area equal to at least 50% of this calculated area with a Class C absorber or better."
The absorptive material should be equally distributed between all floor levels.
"It will normally be convenient to cover the underside of intermediate landings, the underside of the other landings, and the ceiling area on the top floor."
Method A can generally be satisfied by the use of proprietary acoustic ceilings.
"However, the absorptive material can be applied to any surface that faces into the space."
takes account of the existing absorption provided by all surfaces.
"In some cases, Method B should allow greater flexibility in meeting Requirement E3 and require less additional absorption than Method A."
"For an absorptive material of surface area, S in m², and sound absorption coefficient, α the absorption area A is equal to the product of S and α."
"The total absorption area, AT, in square metres is defined as the hypothetical area of a totally absorbing surface, which if it were the only absorbing element in the space would give the same reverberation time as the space under consideration."
"For n surfaces in a space, the total absorption area, AT, can be found using the following equation."
"For entrance halls, provide a minimum of 0.20m² total absorption area per cubic metre of the volume."
The additional absorptive material should be distributed over the available surfaces.
"For corridors or hallways, provide a minimum of 0.25m² total absorption area per cubic metre of the volume."
The additional absorptive material should be distributed over one or more of the surfaces.
Absorption areas should be calculated for each octave band.
Requirement E3 will be satisfied when the appropriate amount of absorption area is provided for each octave band between 250Hz and 4000Hz inclusively.
Absorption coefficient data (to two decimal places) should be taken from the following:
"• For specific products, use laboratory measurements of absorption coefficient data determined using BS EN 20354:1993 Acoustics."
Measurement of sound absorption in a reverberation room.
"The measured third octave band data should be converted to practical sound absorption coefficient data, αp in octave bands, according to BS EN ISO 11654:1997 Acoustics."
Sound absorbers for use in buildings.
Rating of sound absorption.
"• For generic materials, use Table 7.1."
This contains typical absorption coefficient data for common materials used in buildings.
These data may be supplemented by published octave band data for other generic materials.
"In Method B, each calculation step is to be 7.21 rounded to two decimal places."
"Hard floor coverings (e.g. lino, parquet) on concrete floor"
"Evidence that Requirement E3 has been satisfied should be presented, for example on a drawing or in a report, which should include:"
"The approach used to satisfy Requirement E3, Method A or B."
"• With Method A, state the absorber class and the area to be covered."
"• With Method B, state the total absorption area of additional absorptive material used to satisfy the requirement."
Plans indicating the assignment of the absorptive material in the enclosed space.
The entrance hall has dimensions 3.0m (width) x 4.0m (length) x 2.5m (height).
"The concrete floor is covered with carpet, the walls are painted concrete blocks and there are four timber doors (1.0m x 2.4m)."
"To satisfy Requirement E3, either use:"
"• Method A: Cover at least 3.0 x 4.0 = 12m² with a Class C absorber or better, or"
• Method B: Provide a minimum of 0.2m² absorption area per cubic metre of the volume.
Method B is described in steps 1 to 8 in Table 7.2.
"In this example, the designer considers that covering the entire ceiling is a convenient way to provide the additional absorption."
"The aim of the calculation is to determine the absorption coefficient, αceiling, needed for the entire ceiling."
from Method B indicate that a Class D absorber could be used to cover the ceiling.
"This can be compared against the slightly higher absorption requirement of Method A, which would have used a Class C absorber or better to cover the ceiling."
"Step 1 Calculate the surface area related to each absorptive material (i.e. for the floor, walls, doors and ceiling)."
"Step 2 Obtain values of absorption coefficients for the carpet, painted concrete block walls and the timber doors."
"In this case, the values are taken from Table 7.1."
"Step 3 Calculate the absorption area (m2) related to each absorptive surface (i.e. for the floor, walls and doors) in octave frequency bands (Absorption area = surface area x absorption coefficient)."
Step 4 Calculate the sum of the absorption areas (m2) obtained in Step 3.
Step 5 Calculate the total absorption area (AT) required for the entrance hall.
The volume is 30m3 and therefore 0.2 x 30.0 = 6.0m2 of absorption area is required.
AT (m2) Step 6 Calculate additional absorption area (A) to be provided by ceiling (m2).
"If any values of minimum absorption area are negative, e.g. see 2000Hz and 4000Hz, then there is sufficient absorption from the other surfaces to meet the requirement without any additional absorption in this octave band (Additional absorption = AT – total absorption area (from Step 5))."
negative values indicate that no additional absorption is necessary.
Step 7 Calculate required absorption coefficient (α) to be provided by ceiling (Required absorption coefficient α = Additional absorption area / area of ceiling).
Step 8 Identify a ceiling product from manufacturer’s laboratory measurement data that provides absorption coefficients that exceed the values calculated in Step 7.
"In the Secretary of State’s view the normal way of satisfying Requirement E4 will be to meet the values for sound insulation, reverberation time and internal ambient noise which are given in Building Bulletin 93."

Where a mass is specified it is expressed as mass per unit area in kilograms per square metre (kg/m²).
The mass may be obtained from the manufacturer or it may be calculated by the method given in this annex.
To calculate the mass per unit area of a masonry leaf use the formula below.
This formula is not exact but is sufficient for this purpose.
Note: This formula provides the mass per unit area of the block/brick construction without surface finish.
Note: See Diagram A.1 for block and mortar dimensions.
"When calculating the mass per unit area for bricks and blocks use the density at the appropriate moisture content from Table 3.2, CIBSE Guide A (1999)."
For cavity walls the mass per unit area of each leaf is calculated and added together.
Two examples are given (see Table A.1 and A.2) using the equation in A2.1.
For each of these examples a simplified equation is obtained for that type of construction.
Substituting for MB in this formula gives the following values:
The mass of a beam and block floor can be calculated from:
Substituting for MB in this formula gives the following values:
The mass per unit area of surface finishes should be obtained from manufacturer’s data.
"The mass of a solid and homogeneous floor (without hollows, beams or ribs) can be calculated from:"
Note: See Diagram A.2 for beam and block floor dimensions.
"For other floor types (including floors with variable thickness), seek advice from the manufacturer on mass per unit area and performance."
Section B.2 of this Annex describes the sound insulation testing procedure approved by the Secretary of State for the purposes of Regulation 41(2)(a) of the Building Regulations and Regulation 20(1) of the Approved Inspectors Regulations.
The approved procedure is that set out in Section B.2 and the Standards referred to in that Section.
"Section B.3 of this Annex provides guidance on laboratory testing in connection with achieving compliance with Requirement E2 in Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations, and in connection with evaluation of components to be used in constructions subject to Requirement E1."
Section B.4 of this Annex gives guidance on test reports.
The person carrying out the building work should arrange for sound insulation testing to be carried out by a test body with appropriate third party accreditation.
Test bodies conducting testing should preferably have UKAS accreditation (or a European equivalent) for field measurements.
The ODPM also regards members of the ANC Registration Scheme as suitably qualified to carry out pre-completion testing.
"The measurement instrumentation used should have a valid, traceable certificate of calibration, and should have been tested within the past two years."
"Sound insulation testing for the purposes of Regulation 41 of the Building Regulations and Regulation 20(1) and (5) of the Approved Inspectors Regulations 2010, must be done in accordance with: BS EN ISO 140-4:1998; BS EN ISO 140- 7:1998; BS EN ISO 717-1:1997; BS EN ISO 717-2:1997; BS EN 20354:1993."
"When calculating sound insulation test results, no rounding should occur in any calculation until required by the relevant Standards, the BS EN ISO 140 series and the BS EN ISO 717 series."
Airborne sound insulation of a separating wall or floor
The airborne sound insulation of a separating wall or floor should be measured in accordance with BS EN ISO 140-4:1998.
All measurements and calculations should be carried out using one-third octave frequency bands.
"Performance should be rated in terms of the weighted standardised level difference, DnT,w, and spectrum adaptation term, Ctr, in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-1:1997."
"For each source position, the average sound pressure level in the source and receiving rooms is measured in one-third octave bands using either fixed microphone positions (and averaging these values on an energy basis) or a moving microphone."
"For the source room measurements, the difference between the average sound pressure levels in adjacent one-third octave bands should be no more than 6dB."
"If this condition is not met, the source spectrum should be adjusted and the source room measurement repeated."
"If the condition is met, the average sound pressure level in the receiving room, and hence a level difference, should be determined."
"It is essential that all measurements made in the source and receiving rooms to determine a level difference should be made without moving the sound source or changing the output level of the sound source, once its spectrum has been correctly adjusted (where necessary)."
The sound source should now be moved to the next position in the source room and the above procedure repeated to determine another level difference.
At least two positions should be used for the source.
"The level differences obtained from each source position should be arithmetically averaged to determine the level difference, D as defined in BS EN ISO 140-4:1998."
"For multiple sound sources operating simultaneously, the average sound pressure level in the source and receiving rooms is measured in one-third octave bands using either fixed microphone positions (and averaging these values on an energy basis) or a moving microphone."
"For the source room measurements, the difference between the average sound pressure levels in adjacent one-third octave bands should be no more than 6dB."
"If this condition is not met, the source spectrum should be adjusted and the source room measurement repeated."
"If the condition is met, determine the average level in the receiving room, and hence the level difference, D as defined in BS EN ISO 140-4:1998."
Impact sound transmission of a separating floor
The impact sound transmission of a separating floor should be measured in accordance with BS EN ISO 140-7:1998.
All measurements and calculations should be carried out using one-third-octave frequency bands.
"Performance should be rated in terms of the weighted standardised impact sound pressure level, L’nT,w in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-2:1997."
BS EN ISO 140-4:1998 and BS EN ISO 140-7:1998 refer to the ISO 354 (BS EN 20354:1993) method for measuring reverberation time.
"However, for the approved procedure, the guidance in BS EN ISO 140-7:1998 relating to the source and microphone positions, and the number of decay measurements required, should be followed."
Section 1 gives guidance on the room types that should be used for testing.
These rooms should have volumes of at least 25m³. If this is not possible then the volumes of the rooms used for testing should be reported.
Tests should be conducted in completed but unfurnished rooms or available spaces in the case of properties sold before fitting out; see Section 1.
"Impact sound insulation tests should be conducted on a floor without a soft covering (e.g. carpet, foam backed vinyl) except in the case of (a) separating floor type 1, as described in this Approved Document, or (b) a concrete structural floor base which has a soft covering as an integral part of the floor."
"If a soft covering has been installed on any other type of floor, it should be taken up."
"If that is not possible, at least half of the floor should be exposed and the tapping machine should be placed only on the exposed part of the floor."
"When measuring airborne sound insulation between a pair of rooms of unequal volume, the sound source should be in the larger room."
Doors and windows should be closed.
"Kitchen units, cupboards etc. on all walls should have their doors open and be unfilled."
Sound pressure levels should be measured to 0.1dB precision.
Reverberation times should be measured to 0.01s precision.
At least two positions should be used.
"For measurements of reverberation time, discrete positions should be used rather than a moving microphone."
-completion testing for the purposes of Regulation 41 and Regulation 20(1) and (5) involves field testing on separating walls and floors (see Section 1 and Annex B: B2).
and flanking laboratory tests to indicate the performance of novel constructions.
"When calculating sound insulation test results, no rounding should occur in any calculation until required by the relevant Standards, i.e. the BS EN ISO 140 series and the BS EN ISO 717 series."
Floor coverings and floating floors should be tested in accordance with BS EN ISO 140-8:1998 and rated in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-2:1997.
The test floor should have a thickness of 140mm.
It should be noted that text has been omitted from BS EN ISO 140-8:1998.
"For the purposes of this Approved Document, Section 6.2.1 of BS EN ISO 140-8:1998 should be disregarded, and Section 5.3.3 of BS EN ISO 140-7:1998, respectively, referred to instead."
"BS EN ISO 140-8:1998 refers to the ISO 354 (BS EN 20354:1993) method for measuring reverberation time, but the guidance in BS EN ISO 140-8:1998 relating to the source and microphone positions, and the number of decay measurements required, should be followed."
"When assessing category II test specimens (as defined in BS EN ISO 140-8:1998) for use with separating floor type 2, the performance value (DLw) should be achieved when the floating floor is both loaded and unloaded."
"The loaded measurements should use a uniformly distributed load of 20–25kg/m² with at least one weight per square metre of the flooring area, as described in BS EN ISO 140-8:1998."
Dynamic stiffness of resilient layers should be measured in accordance with BS EN 29052-1:1992.
The test method using sinusoidal signals should be used.
No pre-compression should be applied to the test specimens before the measurements.
Dynamic stiffness of wall ties should be measured in accordance with BRE Information Paper IP 3/01.
"3:1995, and the performance rated in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-1:1997 to determine the weighted sound reduction index, Rw."
"Tests of sound transmission in a flanking laboratory include both direct and flanking paths, and are a useful means of assessing the likely field performance of novel constructions."
Test reports should include the following information.
"Organisation conducting test, including:"

It is not possible to demonstrate compliance with Requirement E1 using test results from a flanking laboratory.
"Construction details of a suitable laboratory can be obtained from the Acoustics Centre, BRE, Garston, Watford WD25 9XX."
Note: A CEN standard for the laboratory measurement of flanking transmission between adjoining rooms is currently under development.
"When a test construction has airborne sound insulation of at least 49dB DnT,w + Ctr when measured in a flanking laboratory using the procedure given in Annex B: B2, this can be taken as indicative that the same construction (i.e. identical in all significant details) may achieve at least 45dB DnT,w + Ctr when built in the field."
See paragraph B3.11.
"When a test construction has impact sound insulation no more than 58dB L’nT,w when measured in a flanking laboratory using the procedure given in Annex B: B2, this can be taken as indicative that the same construction (i.e. identical in all significant details) may achieve no more than 62dB L’nT,w when built in the field."
See paragraph B3.11.
"Paragraph 1.41 of this Approved Document sets out the manner of recording the results of testing done for the purposes of Regulation 41 or Regulation 20(1) and (5), approved by the Secretary of State under those Regulations."
"Although not required, it may be useful to have a description of the building including:"
sketches showing the layout and dimensions of rooms tested;
"description of separating walls, external walls, separating floors, and internal walls and floors including details of materials used for their construction and finishes;"

the notification specifies the unique number or numbers issued by Robust Details Ltd in respect of the specified use of the design detail or details;
the building work carried out in respect of the part or parts of the building identified in the notification is in accordance with the design detail or details specified in the notification.
"If the notification is late, or if it does not specify the relevant part or parts, the design detail or details in question and the unique number or numbers, the part or parts of the building in question are subject to sound insulation testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5) in the usual way."
"If the notification is itself valid but the work is not carried out in accordance with the design detail or details, the relevant separating structures become subject to sound insulation testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5)."
It would be open to the builder to take remedial action such that the building control body was satisfied that the work had been brought into compliance with the specified detail or details.
"With that exception, testing under Regulation 41 or 20(1) and (5) would be needed on all structures that have been subject to a valid notification under Regulation 41(4) or 20(1) and (5) but which in the opinion of the building control body have not then been constructed in accordance with the specified detail or details."
"It should be noted that the compliance of work with a robust detail, in circumstances where the correct procedures have been followed to attract exemption from PCT, is not a ‘deemed to satisfy’ condition."
The underlying requirement remains to achieve compliance with Part E1.
The guidance in Approved Document E is that compliance will usually be established by the measured performance of the structure.
"Therefore it would be open to anyone, e.g. a homeowner, who considered that a party structure does not comply with Part E1, to seek to establish that by the carrying out of tests."
"It would not be a defence for the builder to show that he had correctly carried out a design detail approved by Robust Details Ltd, if the structure’s measured performance were shown not to meet the performance standards in Approved Document E."
"Robust Details Ltd is a non-profit distributing company, limited by guarantee, set up by the house-building industry."
"Its objectives are broadly to identify, arrange testing and, if satisfied, approve and publish design details that, if correctly implemented in separating structures, should achieve compliance with Requirement E1."
It also carries out checks on the performance achieved in practice.
"The robust design details are available in a handbook, which may be purchased from Robust Details Ltd."
"Although the design details are in the public domain, their use in building work is not authorised unless the builder has registered the particular use of the relevant design detail or details with Robust Details Ltd and obtained a unique number or numbers from the company."
Each unique number identifies a house or flat in which one or more of the design details are being used.
The system of unique numbers makes possible an essential part of Robust Details Ltd’s procedures for ensuring that design details it has approved deliver reasonable sound insulation performance in practice.
Robust Details Ltd carries out a programme of checks on a proportion of cases where approved design details are used.
"Regulations 2010, the requirement for appropriate sound insulation testing imposed by Regulations 41 and 20(1) does not apply to parts of the building which would otherwise be subject to the testing requirement where all the following apply:"
the building work consists of the erection of a new dwelling-house (i.e. a semi-detached or terraced house) or a building containing flats;
"the person carrying out the building work notifies the building control body before the start of building work on site that, in a specified part or parts of the building, he is using one or more specified design details from those approved by Robust Details Ltd."
"In a case where building control is being carried out by the local authority, the notification must be given not later than the date on which notice of commencement of construction is given under Regulation 16(1) of the Building Regulations 2010;"
"This approved document is Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings."

A unit that contains both living accommodation and space for commercial purposes (e.g. for a workshop or office) should be treated as a dwelling if the commercial part can be reverted to domestic use.
ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 0.12 The commercial part of the building can be reverted to domestic use if all of the following apply.
There is direct access between the commercial space and the living accommodation.
The commercial space and living accommodation are within the same thermal envelope.
The living accommodation comprises a substantial proportion of the total area of the unit.
What constitutes a ‘substantial proportion’ should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the building control body.
A large non-domestic building that contains a small flat for a manager is not treated as a dwelling.
A dwelling that contains a room used as an office or utility space is still treated as a dwelling.
"When constructing a dwelling as part of a larger building that contains other types of accommodation, sometimes called a mixed-use development, refer to the two volumes of Approved Document F as follows."
"For guidance on each individual dwelling, use this approved document: Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings."
"For guidance on the non-dwelling parts of the building, such as shared communal rooms and commercial or retail space, use Approved Document F, Volume 2: Buildings other than dwellings."
"The approved documents set out what, in ordinary circumstances, may be accepted as one way to comply with the Building Regulations."
"Those designing or undertaking building work remain responsible for assessing, on a case-by-case basis, whether specific circumstances require additional or alternative measures to comply with the regulatory requirements."
There are interactions between many of the requirements of the Building Regulations.
Guidance on some key interactions is given below.
"The requirements of Part B apply if, for example, ducts pass through any of the following."
A fire resisting structure.
A fire compartment.
A protected stairway.
ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 0.16 This approved document gives guidance on window openings for ventilation.
"In addition, Approved Document B gives guidance on the size of escape windows."
The larger of the window openings specified in Approved Document B or Approved Document F should be applied in all cases.
Ventilation fans might cause combustion gases to spill from open-flued appliances.
"These combustion gases might fill the room instead of going up the flue or chimney, even if the combustion appliance and fan are in separate rooms."
The guidance in Approved Document J should be followed when installing and testing ventilation appliances.
Combustion appliances must operate safely whether or not fans are running.
Energy efficiency should be considered when specifying ventilation systems.
"Energy efficiency, including the control of infiltration, is dealt with under Part L of the Building Regulations."
"Manual controls, where provided for a ventilation device, should be within reasonable reach of the occupants."
Follow the guidance in Approved Documents K and M.
This document sets minimum standards for purge ventilation for rapidly diluting indoor air pollutants and extracting water vapour where necessary in habitable rooms in dwellings.
"For domestic-type buildings, Part O may require a higher standard than the guidance given in this document for purge ventilation to remove excess heat."
"In this case, the higher of the two standards should be followed."
This section deals with the requirements of Part F1(1) of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
Requirement F1 does not apply to a building or space within a building:
provided for people in the building.
into which people do not normally go;
which is used solely for storage; or
which is a garage used solely in connection with a single dwelling.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement F1(1) is met if the dwelling has a means of ventilation that achieves all of the following."
"Extracts water vapour and indoor air pollutants from areas where they are produced in significant quantities (e.g. kitchens, utility rooms and bathrooms) before they spread through the building, following the guidance on extract ventilation in paragraphs 1.17 to 1.22."
"Supplies a minimum level of outdoor air for occupants’ health, following the guidance for whole dwelling ventilation in paragraphs 1.23 to 1.25."
"Rapidly dilutes indoor air pollutants, and disperses water vapour when necessary in habitable rooms, following the guidance for purge ventilation in paragraphs 1.26 to 1.31."
"Minimises the entry of external air pollutants, following the guidance in Section 2."
"Achieves all of the following, as far as is reasonably practicable."
"Produces low levels of noise, following the guidance in paragraphs 1.5 to 1.7."
"Offers easy access for maintenance, following the guidance in paragraph 1.8."
Provides protection from cold draughts.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement F1(1) is met for work on an existing dwelling by following the guidance in Section 3."
The aim of requirement F1(1) is to protect the health of occupants of the building by providing adequate ventilation.
"Without adequate ventilation, mould and internal air pollution might become hazardous to health."
The guidance in this approved document is not designed to deal with the products of tobacco smoking or vaping.
The building should provide the ventilation rates given in this section.
"Other ventilation solutions may be used, if it can be shown to the building control body that they satisfy requirement F1(1)."
The ventilation rates set out in this approved document have been designed to meet the indoor pollutant levels in Appendix B where the outside air is of reasonable quality.
"In areas where the outside air is not of reasonable quality, Section 2 provides guidance on limiting the entry of external air pollutants."
"Mechanical ventilation systems, including both continuous and intermittent mechanical ventilation, should be designed and installed to minimise noise."
This includes doing all of the following.
Correctly sizing and jointing ducts.
"Ensuring that equipment is appropriately and securely fixed, such as using resilient mountings where noise carried by the structure of the building could be a problem."
"Selecting appropriate equipment, including following paragraph 1.6."
"For mechanical ventilation systems, fan units should be appropriately sized so that fans operating in normal background ventilation mode are not overly noisy."
This might require fans to be sized so that they do not operate near maximum capacity when in normal background ventilation mode.
Account should be taken of outside noise when considering whether openable windows are appropriate for purge ventilation.
"Although there is no requirement to undertake noise testing, achieving the levels in the following guidance would ensure good acoustic conditions."
The average A-weighted sound pressure level for a ventilator operating under normal conditions and not at boost rates should not exceed both of the following.
"30dB LAeq,T* for noise-sensitive rooms (e.g. bedrooms and living rooms) when a continuous mechanical ventilation system is running on its minimum low rate."
"45dB LAeq,T* in less noise-sensitive rooms (e.g. kitchens and bathrooms) when a continuous operation system is running at the minimum high rate or an intermittent operation system is running."
"F1(1)ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION * The noise index LAeq,T is used in BS 8233, where T is the duration of the measurement."
"If the noise from the sound source is steady (i.e. fluctuating by up to 3dB), a measuring time of 1 minute will be adequate and the LAeq, 1 min level will be similar to the dB(A) level used elsewhere."
"lf the noise from the sound source fluctuates more than this, a longer measuring time (T) may be required, but the higher portion of the fluctuating level should be considered, and the sound may attract more attention due to the changes in level."
"Methods for measuring the sound power level produced by the fan unit of decentralised extract ventilation, centralised extract ventilation and balanced mechanical ventilation with heat recovery systems are described in BS EN 13141."
"Reasonable access should be provided for maintaining ventilation systems, including all of the following."
"Providing access to replace filters, fans and coils."
Providing access points for cleaning ductwork.
Providing access for the general maintenance of the plant.
The ventilation strategy in this approved document relies on a combination of all of the following.
"Extract ventilation from rooms where water vapour or pollutants are likely to be released (e.g. bathrooms and kitchens), to minimise their spread to the rest of the building."
Ventilation fans may be either intermittent operation or continuous operation.
"Whole dwelling ventilation to provide fresh air to the building and to dilute, disperse and remove water vapour and pollutants not removed by extract ventilation."
Purge ventilation to remove high concentrations of pollutants and water vapour.
Purge ventilation is used intermittently and required only for pollutants produced by occasional activities (e.g. fumes from painting).
"Ventilation may be delivered through natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation or a combination of both."
The ventilation systems in this approved document are examples of systems that comply with Part F of the Building Regulations.
Other ventilation systems may be acceptable if they can be shown to meet an equal level of performance.
Performance criteria for acceptable levels of moisture and pollutants are given in Appendix B. Ventilation rates designed to meet the performance criteria are given in Tables 1.1 to 1.3.
Ventilator sizes for the whole dwelling are also provided in Table 1.7 to help designers comply with Part F of the Building Regulations in common situations.
"Some ventilation system designs can, in certain circumstances, result in lower ventilation rates than those stated in Table 1.1 and Table 1.2 (e.g. systems with automatic controls)."
"The size of background ventilators (including trickle ventilators) is given in this approved document as an equivalent area in mm2, not as a free area."
BS EN 13141-1 includes a method of measuring the equivalent area of background ventilator openings.
"Background ventilators should have the equivalent area marked where it will be easy to see from inside the dwelling when installed, to aid verification by building control bodies."
Extract ventilation to the outside should be provided in all of the following spaces.
Extract ventilation can be intermittent or continuous.
Minimum extract ventilation rates in litres per second (l/s) for intermittent operation extract systems are given in Table 1.1.
Minimum extract ventilation rates for continuous operation extract systems are given in Table 1.2.
"Extract ventilation terminals and fans, not including cooker extract hoods, should be installed to comply with both of the following conditions."
As high as is practicable in the room.
A maximum of 400mm below the ceiling.
"Where a cooker hood is used to extract to the outside, the height of the extract hood above the hob surface should be either as specified in the manufacturer’s instructions or, if no specification is available, between 650mm and 750mm."
"As an alternative for sanitary accommodation, the purge ventilation guidance may be used."
The cooker hood should span at least the full width of the cooker.
The diagram includes a recirculating cooker hood for illustration.
A recirculating cooker hood on its own does not provide a means of ventilation that complies with Part F of the Building Regulations.
F1(1)ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 1.22 Minimum extract ventilation rates for continuous extract systems are specified in Table 1.2.
A continuous rate is given for the general operation of the fan and a high rate for when additional extraction is required.
"If the continuous rate of ventilation provided in a room is equal to or higher than the minimum high rate specified in the table, no extra ventilation is needed."
Supply air for the dwelling should be delivered through one of the following means.
Continuous supply fans.
The minimum whole dwelling ventilation rate for the supply of air to the habitable rooms in a dwelling should meet both of the following conditions.
"A minimum rate of 0.3 litres per second per m2 of internal floor area (this includes all floors, e.g. for a two-storey building, add the ground-floor and first-floor areas)."
"A minimum rate determined by the number of bedrooms, as specified in Table 1.3."
"For each additional bedroom, add 6l/s to the values in Table 1.3."
"If the dwelling only has one habitable room, a minimum ventilation rate of 13l/s should be used."
Internal doors should allow air to flow through the dwelling by providing a minimum free area equivalent to a 10mm undercut in a 760mm wide door.
Doors should be undercut to achieve one of the following.
If the floor finish is fitted: 10mm above the floor finish.
If the floor finish is not fitted: 20mm above the floor surface.
A system for purge ventilation should be provided in each habitable room.
Purge ventilation should be capable of extracting at least four air changes per hour per room directly to the outside.
In order to demonstrate compliance with Part O of the Building Regulations it is likely that higher purge ventilation rates than those given in paragraph 1.29 will be required.
Purge ventilation should be delivered through one of the following means.
Openings (e.g. windows or doors).
A mechanical extract ventilation system.
"Where purge ventilation is delivered through openings in a habitable room, the minimum opening areas in Table 1.4 should be achieved."
"The values in Table 1.4 are based on BS 5925, which assumes all of the following."
Single-sided ventilation.
An urban environment.
A wind speed of 2.1 metres per second (m/s).
A temperature difference of 3°C between the air inside and outside the building.
"Depending on the dwelling design or the external climate, it may be possible in certain circumstances to achieve four air changes per hour with smaller openings."
"If smaller openings than those given in Table 1.4 are specified, expert advice should be sought to ensure that the design complies with requirement F1(1)."
Hinged or pivot windows with an opening angle of less than 15 degrees are not suitable for purge ventilation.
The air flow resistance of all components should be considered when specifying ventilation systems.
"The complete assembly, as installed, should be designed to meet the performance standards of this approved document."
The performance of the separate components should be measured according to the relevant parts of BS EN 13141 and other relevant standards.
The relevant test standards for common equipment types are given in Table 1.5.
Ventilation should be controllable.
Controls may be either manual (i.e. operated by the occupant) or automatic.
"Background ventilators should be at least 1700mm above floor level, to reduce cold draughts, but still be easy for the occupant to reach."
Background ventilators are intended to normally be left open.
Continuously running fans should be set up to operate without occupant intervention but may have manual or automatic controls for selecting the high rate of operation.
"Any manual high rate controls should be provided locally to the spaces being served, e.g. bathrooms and kitchens."
"Automatic controls might include sensors for humidity, occupancy/usage and pollutant release."
"Controls based on humidity sensors may be installed in moisture-generating rooms (e.g. kitchen or bathroom) but should not be used for sanitary accommodation, where odour is the main pollutant."
Other types of automatic controls might be suitable.
"Where present, automatic controls should operate according to the need for ventilation in the space."
Background ventilators with automatic controls should also have manual override.
"Where a combustion appliance is installed, any automatic controls must also ensure that the ventilation provided meets the requirements of Part J of the Building Regulations."
"In addition to paragraphs 1.12 to 1.37, the performance required for ventilation systems for dwellings with basements would be achieved by following the guidance in paragraphs 1.39 to 1.41."
"A dwelling that includes a basement connected to the above ground parts of the dwelling by a large permanent opening (e.g. an open stairway), may be treated as a multi-storey dwelling when following the guidance in this approved document for dwellings without basements."
"If a basement has only one exposed façade, the guidance for natural ventilation given in this approved document would not be appropriate."
"In such cases, expert advice should be sought."
F1(1)ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 1.40 A dwelling with a basement that is not connected to the rest of the dwelling above ground level by a large permanent opening should be considered as follows.
The part of the dwelling above ground level should be considered separately.
The basement should be treated separately as a single-storey dwelling above ground level.
"If the basement has no bedrooms, it should be treated as having one bedroom when calculating the ventilation required for the purposes of meeting the ventilation standards."
A dwelling that is only a basement should be treated as a single-storey dwelling above ground level.
"In such circumstances, the guidance for dwellings without basements should be followed."
"The guidance on natural ventilation, however, is not appropriate for a dwelling that is only a basement."
"If a habitable room does not contain windows that can be opened (e.g. an internal room), the requirement to provide adequate ventilation can be met using paragraphs 1.43 and 1.44."
This guidance can be used if the room is ventilated through either of the following.
Another habitable room.
The habitable room or conservatory should have openings to the outside to provide both of the following.
"Purge ventilation with a minimum total area given in paragraph 1.29, based on the combined floor area of the habitable rooms (or the habitable room and the conservatory)."
"Background ventilation of at least 10,000mm2 equivalent area."
Between the two rooms there should be a permanent opening with a minimum area of 1/20 of the combined floor area of the two rooms (see Diagram 1.3).
"Purge ventilation opening,"
"10,000mm2 background ventilator"
Paragraphs 1.46 to 1.73 give guidance for the types of ventilation system listed in Table 1.6.
"For situations outside the scope of Table 1.6, expert advice should be sought for the design, sizing and position of ventilators to provide effective ventilation."
"As defined in Appendix A, less airtight dwellings are dwellings which have one of the following."
A design air permeability higher than 5m3/(h·m2) at 50Pa.
An as-built air permeability higher than 3m3/(h·m2) at 50Pa.
"Where a dwelling has natural ventilation and a measured air permeability that differs from the design air permeability, so that it is defined as a highly airtight dwelling, one of the following applies."
Expert advice should be sought.
A continuous mechanical extract ventilation system should be installed by following the guidance in paragraphs 1.60 to 1.66.
Continuous mechanical extract ventilation systems are available as decentralised options.
An intermittent extract fan may be replaced with a decentralised continuous mechanical extract ventilation system fan.
Intermittent extract fans should be fitted in all wet rooms.
"For kitchens, utility rooms, bathrooms and sanitary accommodation, the extract rates in Table 1.1 can be met using an intermittent extract fan."
"If a wet room has no external walls, the intermittent extract fan should extract at four air changes per hour to meet the purge ventilation standards in paragraphs 1.26 to 1.31."
"For sanitary accommodation, extract rates can be met using windows by following the purge ventilation guidance in paragraphs 1.26 to 1.31."
Any automatic controls (e.g. humidity control) for intermittent extract should have a manual override to allow the occupant to turn the extract ventilation on or off.
"In a room with no openable window, an intermittent extract fan should be provided with controls which continue to operate the fan for at least 15 minutes after the room is vacated."
All rooms with external walls should have background ventilators.
"If a habitable room has no external walls, paragraphs 1.42 to 1.44 should be followed."
F1(1)ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION NOTE:
"A window with a night latch position is not adequate for background ventilation, due to the following."
The risk of draughts.
The difficulty of measuring the equivalent area.
"If the dwelling has more than one exposed façade, the area of background ventilators on each façade should be similar, to allow cross-ventilation."
"If an exposed façade is close to an area of sustained and loud noise (e.g. a main road), then a noise attenuating background ventilator should be fitted."
"If fans and background ventilators are fitted in the same room, they should be at least 500mm apart."
The minimum total area of background ventilators in each room should follow the guidance in Table 1.7.
The total number of ventilators installed in the dwelling’s habitable rooms and kitchens should be at least the following.
Four ventilators if the dwelling has one bedroom.
Five ventilators if the dwelling has more than one bedroom.
"If the dwelling has a kitchen and living room which are not separate rooms, at least three ventilators of the same area as for other habitable rooms in Table 1.7 should be provided in the open-plan space."
The use of this table is not appropriate in any of the following situations and expert advice should be sought.
• • • If the dwelling has only one exposed façade.

"When other building work is carried out that will affect the ventilation of the existing dwelling, for example:"
replacing a window or door
the ventilation of the dwelling should either:
not be less satisfactory than before the work was carried out.
Ventilation through infiltration should be considered to be part of the ventilation provision of a dwelling.
Reducing infiltration might reduce the indoor air quality of the dwelling below the standards given in Appendix B.
"For common types of work, the requirements of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 may be demonstrated by following the guidance detailed below."
"For installing energy efficiency measures excluding window replacement, paragraphs 3.6 to 3.13."

Guidance in Section 1 should be followed.
Ventilation equipment is considered to be a ‘controlled service or fitting’ and providing or extending this equipment in or in connection with a building is considered to be building work.
Some building work does not need to be notified to the local authority.
Details of such work are set out in the Manual to the Building Regulations.
Installing energy efficiency measures 3.6 Many existing dwellings are ventilated through infiltration rather than purposeful ventilation.
Energy efficiency measures carried out on existing dwellings might reduce infiltration and cause the dwelling to become under-ventilated.
Building work should not reduce the ventilation provision of the dwelling unless it can be demonstrated that the ventilation provision after the work is carried out meets the minimum standards of requirement F1(1).
"When carrying out energy efficiency measures to an existing dwelling, an assessment should determine what, if any, additional ventilation provision is needed, based on the estimated impact of the work."
The assessment should be carried out by one of the following means.
Applying the simplified method in paragraphs 3.8 to 3.13.
"Seeking expert advice, which may include carrying out an air permeability test that follows the procedures given in Approved Document L, Volume 1: Dwellings."
Following BSI PAS 2035 is considered to be an adequate means of demonstrating compliance with paragraph 3.6.
Simplified method NOTE:
provided ventilation and infiltration.
"If the property differs significantly from this assumption, the requirements of paragraph 3.6 must still be met."
This should be demonstrated through seeking expert advice or using another suitable method.
"When carrying out energy efficiency measures on an existing dwelling, Table 3.1 should be used to calculate the number of major and minor energy efficiency measures involved."
This calculation should include all of the following.
"Energy efficiency measures fitted since the original dwelling was constructed, to consider accumulation of measures."
Energy efficiency measures planned.
"Where specific energy efficiency measures are not included in Table 3.1, the most similar category should be chosen instead."
Diagram 3.1 should then be used to determine the category that the works result in.
Loft conversions or works that include changing a cold loft (insulation at ceiling level) to Minor
Sealing and/or insulating a suspended ground floor
"If the energy efficiency works involve only replacing windows, then the guidance in paragraphs 3.14 to 3.16 may be followed as an alternative means of demonstrating compliance."
"Draught-proofing measures might not, on their own, constitute building work."
This work may be controllable under the Building Regulations if carried out as part of other building work.
"If the method in Diagram 3.1 results in the work being categorised as Category A, it is likely that the energy efficiency measures have not reduced the ventilation provision of the dwelling below the requirements of F1(1) so no further ventilation provision is necessary."
"F1(1)ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 3.11 If the method in Diagram 3.1 results in the work being categorised as Category B, it is likely that the ventilation provision of the dwelling has been reduced below the requirements of F1(1)."
Further ventilation provision should be provided by one of the following means.

Appendix D provides a checklist for determining the ventilation provision in an existing dwelling.
It may be used before energy efficiency measures are carried out to establish whether an existing dwelling complies with the requirement for adequate means of ventilation.
"If the existing windows have background ventilators, the replacement windows should include background ventilators."
The new background ventilators should comply with both of the following conditions.
Not be smaller than the background ventilators in the original window.
Be controllable either automatically or by the occupant.
"If the size of the background ventilators in the existing window is not known, the ventilator sizes in paragraph 3.15 may be applied."
Replacing the windows is likely to increase the airtightness of the dwelling.

It is defined as the air leakage rate per hour per m2 of envelope area at the test reference pressure differential of 50Pa or 4Pa. Airtightness The resistance of the building envelope to infiltration when ventilators are closed.
"The greater the airtightness at a given pressure difference across the envelope, the lower the infiltration."
Automatic controls A system whereby a ventilation device is adjusted by a mechanical or electronic controller that responds to a relevant stimulus.
"That stimulus usually relates to the humidity of the air in a room, pollutant levels, occupancy of the space or pressure difference across the device."
Background ventilator A small ventilation opening designed to provide controllable whole dwelling ventilation.
A dwelling or a usable part of a dwelling (i.e. a habitable room) that is partly or entirely below ground level.
"Note that a cellar is distinct from a basement, in that a cellar is used only for storage, heating plant or purposes other than habitation."
Bathroom A room that contains a bath or shower and which can also include sanitary accommodation.
Building control body A local authority or an approved inspector.
"Continuous operation Uninterrupted running of a mechanical ventilation device, such as continuous mechanical extract ventilation or mechanical ventilation with heat recovery."
"The air flow rate provided by mechanical ventilation need not be constant but may be varied, under either manual or automatic control, in response to the demand for the removal of pollutants or water vapour."
Dwelling A self-contained unit designed to accommodate a single household.
Equivalent area A measure of the aerodynamic performance of a ventilator.
"edged circular orifice through which air would pass at the same volume flow rate, under an identical applied pressure difference, as through the opening under consideration."
The equivalent area of a background ventilator is determined at 1Pa pressure difference in accordance with Table 1.7.
Expert advice Advice from a suitably qualified competent person.
"Examples from the ventilation industry of a person competent to give expert advice include a chartered or professional engineer, a building services specialist, a specialist ventilation manufacturer or members of professional trade bodies."
Extract ventilation The removal of air directly from an internal space or spaces to the outside.
Extract ventilation may be by natural means or by mechanical means (e.g. by an extract fan or a central system).
Free area The geometric open area of a ventilator.
"Habitable room A room used for dwelling purposes but which is not solely a kitchen, utility room, bathroom, cellar or sanitary accommodation."
"AONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Heat recovery Applied to mechanical supply and extract systems or a single room ventilator, extract air is passed over a heat exchanger and the recovered heat is put into the supply air."
Highly airtight dwellings Dwellings that achieve one of the following.
(h·m2) at 50Pa.
"Infiltration The uncontrolled exchange of air between the inside and outside of a building, through gaps and cracks."
"Intermittent operation When a mechanical ventilator does not run all the time, usually running only when there is a particular need to remove pollutants or water vapour (e.g. during cooking or bathing)."
Intermittent operation may be under either manual or automatic control.
Less airtight dwellings Those dwellings that are not highly airtight dwellings.
"Manual controls A system whereby a ventilation device is opened and closed, or switched on and off, or its performance is adjusted by the occupants of a room or building (see automatic controls)."
"Material change of use Defined in regulation 5 as: Where there is a change in the purposes for which or the circumstances in which a building is used, so that after that change:"
"the building is used as a dwelling, where previously it was not;"
"the building contains a flat, where previously it did not; c. the building is used as an hotel or a boarding house, where previously it was not;"
"the building is used as an institution, where previously it was not;"
"the building is used as a public building, where previously it was not;"
"the building is not a building described in classes 1 to 6 in Schedule 2, where previously it was;"
"the building, which contains at least one dwelling, contains a greater or lesser number of dwellings than it did previously;"
"the building contains a room for residential purposes, where previously it did not;"
"the building, which contains at least one room for residential purposes, contains a greater or lesser number of such rooms than it did previously;"
"the building is used as a shop, where it previously was not; or"
"the building is a building described in regulation 7(4)(a), where previously it was not."
Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery A mechanically driven ventilation system that both continuously supplies outdoor air to the inside of the dwelling and continuously extracts indoor air and discharges it to the outside.
"For the purposes of this approved document, the guidance for mechanical ventilation with heat recovery applies to centralised or decentralised supply and extract systems, with or without heat recovery."
"Natural ventilation Ventilation provided by thermal, wind or diffusion effects through doors, windows or other intentional openings without the use of mechanically driven equipment."
"For the purposes of this approved document, natural ventilation refers to a ventilation strategy using background ventilators and intermittent extract ventilation."
"Permanent opening An opening between rooms or floors that has no means of closing it, e.g. an open stairwell or two rooms that have been joined by removing part of a wall."
Purge ventilation Manually controlled ventilation of rooms or spaces at a relatively high rate to rapidly dilute pollutants and/or disperse water vapour.
Purge ventilation may be provided by natural means (e.g. an openable window) or mechanical means (e.g. a fan).
"AONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Purpose-provided ventilation That part of the ventilation of a building provided by ventilation devices designed into the building (e.g. background ventilators, extract fans, mechanical ventilation or air-conditioning systems)."
Ventilation The supply and removal of air (by natural and/or mechanical means) to and from a space or spaces in a building.
It normally comprises a combination of purpose-provided ventilation and infiltration.
"Wet room A room used for domestic activities (such as cooking, clothes washing and bathing) that produce significant amounts of airborne moisture, e.g. a kitchen, utility room or bathroom."
"For the purposes of Part F of the Building Regulations, sanitary accommodation is also regarded as a wet room."
"Whole dwelling ventilation (general ventilation) Nominally continuous ventilation of rooms or spaces at a relatively low rate to dilute and remove pollutants and water vapour not removed by extract ventilation, purge ventilation or infiltration, as well as to supply outdoor air into the dwelling."
"Room for residential purposes Defined in regulation 2(1) as a room, or a suite of rooms, which is not a dwelling-house or a flat and which is used by one or more persons to live and sleep and includes a room in a hostel, an hotel, a boarding house, a hall of residence or a residential home, but does not include a room in a hospital, or other similar establishment, used for patient accommodation."
Sanitary accommodation A space containing one or more flush toilets (WCs) or urinals.
Sanitary accommodation containing one or more cubicles counts as one space if there is free circulation of air throughout the space.
"Shared communal rooms Rooms in buildings containing dwellings, which provide facilities for the residents."
"For example, a laundry room, occupied lobby or gym."
"This does not include areas used solely or principally for circulation in buildings containing dwellings, including corridors or lift lobbies."
Surface water activity A measure of the availability of water to micro-organisms.
Surface water activity is determined from the ratio of the vapour pressure of the water in the substrate to the vapour pressure of pure water at the same temperature and pressure.
"This ratio, in steady-state conditions, is numerically equal to the equilibrium relative humidity of the air, except that the latter is commonly expressed as a percentage."
Thermal envelope The combination of thermal elements of a building which enclose a particular conditioned indoor space or group of indoor spaces.
Utility room A room containing a sink or other feature or equipment that may reasonably be expected to produce significant quantities of water vapour.
This appendix sets out the levels of moisture and other pollutants that the provisions in this approved document are designed to control.
The provisions are designed to control all of the following.
"Moisture levels, as described in paragraph B2."
"Indoor air pollutants, as described in paragraph B4."
"Bio-effluents, as described in paragraph B6."
The guidance in this approved document may not be adequate to address pollutants from flueless combustion space heaters.
This approved document does not address the airborne spread of infection and does not directly address contamination from outdoor sources.
A strategy for achieving good indoor air quality includes reducing the release of water vapour and air pollutants.
This approved document does not provide guidance on such strategies.
The performance criterion for moisture is that there should be no visible mould on the inner surfaces of the external walls of a properly heated dwelling with typical moisture generation.
"Mould can grow whether the dwelling is occupied or unoccupied, so the performance criterion for humidity (given in Table B3) should be met at all times, regardless of whether there are occupants."
The other pollutants listed in Table B1 are only of concern when the dwelling is occupied.
The moisture criteria to avoid house dust mite allergens are more complex and demanding than those to avoid mould.
This approved document does not give guidance on the control of house dust mite allergens.
The performance criteria for indoor air pollutants are given in Table B1.
These are based on the World Health Organization’s Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Selected Pollutants (2010) and Public Health England’s Indoor Air Quality Guidelines for Selected Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the UK (2019).
No safe levels can be recommended for benzene or trichloroethylene so they have not been considered in the definition of ventilation rates in dwellings.
The best strategy for reducing their concentration indoors may be to control them at source.
"Even if the designer and builder choose to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) levels in dwellings by controlling them at source, the ventilation requirements must still be met."
The total volatile organic compound (TVOC) metric is representative of all airborne indoor air VOC concentrations and should not be used as a direct indicator of health.
The simplified metric is used as an indicator for the purpose of ventilation control strategies.
"As an alternative to the TVOC limit, individual VOC limits may be used where justified in accordance with the guidance in paragraph B5."
"As an alternative to using TVOC, the individual VOCs may be applied where their use is supported by robust independent evidence."
Public Health England’s Indoor Air Quality Guidelines for Selected Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the UK should be used.
Testing against these metrics is likely to be more complex than testing against TVOC.
Control of bio-effluents (body odours) for people who have been exposed to the environment for a period of time will be achieved by an air supply rate of 4 litres per second per person (BS EN 16798-1).
"Where the guidance for less airtight dwellings is followed, dwellings are assumed to have an infiltration rate of 0.15 air changes per hour."
"Where the guidance for highly airtight dwellings is followed, dwellings are assumed to have an infiltration rate of 0 air changes per hour."
"Ventilation effectiveness is assumed to be 1.0 – that is, it is assumed that supply air is fully mixed with room air."
CIBSE’s Guide A Environmental Design provides further information on ventilation effectiveness.
"BONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION B10 For the purposes of this approved document, for all dwellings (both new and existing, where Part F applies), the moisture criteria are likely to be met if, during the colder months of the year, the moving average surface water activity of the internal surfaces of external walls is always less than the value in Table B2, evaluated over each moving average period."
"For new dwellings, for the purposes of this approved document, the moisture criteria in Table B2 is likely to be met if, during the colder months of the year, the moving average relative humidity in a room is always less than the value given in Table B3, evaluated over each moving average period."
"This installation and commissioning checklist is divided into three parts, as follows."
"Part 1 contains the particulars of the system, installation address and installer’s details."
Part 2a functions as an installation checklist.
"Part 2b is a visual inspection, or pre-commissioning, checklist."
Part 3 is for recording air flow measurements from fans.
"Measured air flow rates for all fans should be recorded on Part 3: Commissioning details, as part of the commissioning procedures given in Section 4 of this approved document."
The measured values should be compared with their respective design values to determine the following.
"If the measured rate for each fan is equal to or greater than the design value, then the system meets the design standard."
"If any measured value is lower than the design value, an adjustment should be made to correct the system."
All air flows should then be remeasured.
"If necessary, further adjustments should be made until all air flows match their design values."

"If practicable, ventilation intakes should not be located in courtyards or enclosed urban spaces where air pollutants are discharged."
"If this is unavoidable, intakes should be located to meet both of the following conditions."
As far as possible from the source of pollutants.
In an open or well-ventilated area.
"In areas where wind often comes from opposing directions (e.g. a valley), the air intakes should point in the opposite direction to the exhaust outlets."

Chapter 13 of McGraw Hill’s Indoor Air Quality Handbook provides further guidance.
"When building work in an existing building includes work on ventilation, for example:"
the work should meet the relevant standards in this approved document.
"When other building work is carried out that will affect the ventilation of the existing building, for example:"
the ventilation of the building should either:
not be less satisfactory than before the work was carried out.
Ventilation through infiltration should be considered to be part of the ventilation provision of a building.
Reducing infiltration might reduce the indoor air quality of the building below the standards given in Appendix B.
"When a building undergoes a material change of use, Part F of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations applies to the building or part of the building that has changed use."
Guidance in Section 1 should be followed.
Ventilation equipment is considered to be a ‘controlled service or fitting’ and providing or extending this equipment in or in connection with a building is considered to be building work.
Some building work does not need to be notified to the local authority.
Details of such work are set out in the Manual to the Building Regulations.
"If work is carried out which increases the energy efficiency of a building, airtightness may be increased."
"In these circumstances, any useful ventilation which was lost should be replaced in order to maintain a healthy indoor environment."
"When carrying out work which is likely to increase the airtightness of the building, it should be demonstrated to the building control body that the work meets the requirements of Part F1(1), where it is an applicable requirement."
Refer to paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 for the relevant standards that should be met.
"For domestic-type installation of common energy efficiency measures in existing buildings, Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings contains guidance on meeting the requirements of Part F of the Building Regulations."
"If the existing windows have background ventilators, the replacement windows should include background ventilators."
The new background ventilators should comply with the following conditions.
Not be smaller than the background ventilators in the original window.
Be controllable either automatically or by the occupant.
"If the size of the background ventilators in the existing window is not known, the ventilator sizes in paragraph 3.6 may be applied."
Replacing the windows is likely to increase the airtightness of the building.
"If ventilation is not provided via a mechanical ventilation system, then increasing the airtightness of the building may reduce beneficial ventilation in the building."
"In these circumstances, it is necessary to ensure that the ventilation provision in the building is no worse than it was before the work was carried out."
This may be demonstrated in any of the following ways.
Incorporating background ventilators in the replacement windows equivalent to the following.
• For floor areas up to 10m2 – minimum 2500mm2 equivalent area.
• For floor areas greater than 10m2 – minimum 250mm2 equivalent area per m2 of floor area.
Domestic-type kitchen – minimum 8000mm2 equivalent area.
Bathroom (with or without a toilet) and shower rooms – minimum 4000mm2 equivalent area per bath or shower.
Sanitary accommodation (and/or washing facilities) – minimum 2000mm2 equivalent area per WC.
"Other ventilation provisions, if it can be demonstrated to a building control body that they comply with the requirements of paragraph 3.2."
"If it is not technically feasible to adopt the minimum equivalent areas set out in paragraph 3.6, the background ventilators should have equivalent areas as close to the minimum value as is feasible."
"If an exposed façade is close to an area of sustained and loud noise (e.g. a main road), then a noise attenuating background ventilator should be fitted."

This appendix sets out the levels of moisture and other pollutants that the provisions in this approved document are designed to control.
The provisions are designed to control all of the following.
"Bio-effluents, as described in paragraph B2a."
"Moisture levels, as described in paragraph B2b."
"Indoor air pollutants, as described in paragraph B2d."
The guidance in this approved document may not be adequate to address pollutants from flueless combustion space heaters.
This approved document does not directly address contamination from outdoor sources.
A strategy for achieving good indoor air quality includes reducing the release of water vapour and air pollutants.
This approved document does not provide guidance on such strategies.
The main guidance within this approved document focuses on offices.
The main performance criteria applied are as follows.
"There should be a supply rate, in the absence of tobacco smoke or other excessive pollutants, of 10 litres per second per person."
This will also satisfy the requirement of 8 litres per second per person needed to control higher levels of bio-effluents.
There should be no visible mould on the inner surfaces of external walls of a properly heated building with typical moisture generation.
"Mould can grow whether the building is occupied or unoccupied, so the performance criteria for surface water activity (as given in Table B2) should be met at all times, regardless of whether there are occupants."
The other pollutants listed in Table B1 are only of concern when the building is occupied.
The performance criteria for indoor air pollutants are given in Table B1.
No safe levels can be recommended for benzene or trichloroethylene so they have not been considered in the definition of ventilation rates in buildings.
The best strategy for reducing their concentration indoors may be to control them at source.
"Even if the designer and builder choose to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) levels in buildings by controlling them at source, the ventilation requirements must still be met."
The total volatile organic compound (TVOC) metric is representative of all airborne indoor air VOC concentrations and should not be used as a direct indicator of health.
The simplified metric is used as an indicator for the purposes of ventilation control strategies.
"As an alternative to the TVOC limit, individual VOC limits may be used where justified in accordance with the guidance in paragraph B3."
"As an alternative to using TVOC, the individual VOCs may be applied where their use is supported by robust independent evidence."
Public Health England’s Indoor Air Quality Guidelines for Selected Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the UK should be used.
Testing against these metrics is likely to be more complex than testing against TVOC.
"Where the Health and Safety Executive gives guidance for specific situations, that guidance should be followed in preference to the guidance given here."
"For the purposes of this approved document, for all offices (both new and existing, where Part F applies), the moisture criteria are likely to be met if, during the colder months of the year, the moving average surface water activity of the internal surfaces of external walls is always less than the value in Table B2, evaluated over each moving average period."
"Office equipment can emit pollutants, including ozone and organic compounds."
"For example, a study by Black and Wortham (1999) suggests the following emission rates for laser printers and dry paper copiers assuming 30 minutes use in an hour."
25mg/h for TVOC.
3mg/h for ozone.
To meet the performance criteria for these pollutants requires an extract rate of 20 litres per second per machine during use.
"For sanitary accommodation, the extract rates used for dwellings have been applied."
"For food and beverage preparation areas, the extract rates used for dwellings have been applied."
The guidance in this appendix is based on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) EMG/SPI-B advisory group paper Application of CO2 monitoring as an approach to managing ventilation to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
People exhale carbon dioxide (CO2) when they breathe out.
If there is a build-up of CO2 in an area it can indicate that ventilation needs to be improved.
Checking levels of CO2 using a monitor can help to identify areas that are poorly ventilated.
Many different types of CO2 monitor are available.
The most appropriate portable devices for use in the workplace are non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 monitors.
How to use a CO2 monitor
The level of CO2 in the air will vary within an indoor space.
"It is best to place CO2 monitors at head height and away from windows, doors or air supply openings."
Monitors that are positioned too close to people may give a misleadingly high reading due to the CO2 in exhaled breath.
Monitors should therefore be positioned at least 500mm away from room occupants.
"Measured levels of CO2 within a space can vary throughout the day due to changes in number of occupants, activities being performed or ventilation rates in the space."
The opening and closing of doors and windows can also have an effect.
The amount of CO2 in the air is measured in parts per million (ppm).
"If measurements in an occupied space seem very low (far below 400ppm) or very high (over 1500ppm), it is possible that the monitor is not in a suitable location."
"The monitor may need to be moved to another position within the space, to get a more accurate reading."
"Instantaneous or ‘snapshot’ CO2 readings can be misleading, so several measurements should be taken throughout the day."
The frequency of measurements should be sufficient to ensure that changes in the use of the room or space throughout the day are represented in the readings.
"Levels of CO2 may also vary throughout the year, as outdoor temperatures, and therefore behaviour relating to opening windows and doors, change."
Check that monitors are within the recommended calibration period.
"Know how to use the monitor correctly, including the time needed to provide a reading."
Take measurements at key times throughout the working day.
"Record CO2 readings, number of occupants, the type of ventilation in use at the time and the date."
These will help you use the CO2 records to decide if an area is poorly ventilated.
"CO2 measurements should be used as a broad guide to ventilation within a space, rather than treated as ‘safe thresholds’."
Outdoor levels are around 400ppm.
A consistent indoor CO2 value of less than 800ppm is likely to indicate that a space is well ventilated.
An average CO2 concentration of 1500ppm over the period when a space is occupied is an indicator of poor ventilation.
Action should be taken to improve ventilation if CO2 readings are consistently higher than 1500ppm.
"However, in locations where continuous talking or singing takes place, or there are high levels of physical activity (such as dancing, playing sport or exercising), providing ventilation sufficient to keep CO2 levels below 800ppm is recommended."
CO2 monitors may not be suitable for use in areas that rely on air-cleaning units because these remove contaminants from the air but do not remove CO2.
"In large, open spaces and spaces with high ceilings, such as food production halls or warehouses, air may not be fully mixed and the measurements made by CO2 monitors may not be representative."
CO2 monitors are of limited use in less populated areas.

"Attention should be paid in particular to the need to comply with Part A (Structure), Part B (Fire safety), Part C (Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture), Part J (Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems), Part L (Conservation of fuel and power) and Part P (Electrical safety), as well as Part G."
What is an Approved Document?
"This document has been approved and issued by the Secretary of State to provide practical guidance on ways of complying with Requirements G1 to G6 and regulations 7 and 36 of the Building Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/2214) for England and Wales, as amended."
The Building Regulations 2010 are referred to throughout the remainder of this Document as ‘the Building Regulations’.
The intention of issuing Approved Documents is to provide guidance about compliance with speciﬁc aspects of the Building Regulations in some of the more common building situations.
"They include examples of what, in ordinary circumstances, may be reasonable provision for compliance with the relevant requirement(s) of the Building Regulations to which they refer."
If guidance in an Approved Document is followed there will be a presumption of compliance with the requirement(s) covered by the guidance.
"However, this presumption is not conclusive, so simply following guidance does not guarantee compliance in an individual case."
It is also important to note that there may well be other ways of achieving compliance with the requirements.
There is therefore no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in this Approved Document if you would prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way.
"However, persons intending to carry out building work should always check with their Building Control Body (BCB), either the local authority or an Approved Inspector, that their proposals comply with Building Regulations."
The guidance contained in this Approved Document relates only to the particular requirements of the Building Regulations that the document addresses (see ‘Requirements’ below).
"However, building work may be subject to more than one requirement of the Building Regulations."
In such cases the work will also have to comply with any other applicable requirements of the Building Regulations.
This document is one of a series that has been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of Schedule 1 and regulation 7 of the Building Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/2214) for England and Wales.
At the back of this document is a list of all the documents that have been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for this purpose.
In this document the following conventions have been adopted to assist understanding and interpretation:
"Regulations, and set out the legal requirements that relate to compliance with the sanitation, hot water safety and water efﬁciency requirements of Building Regulations."
"It should be remembered however that, as noted above, building works must comply with all the other applicable provisions of Building Regulations."
Key terms are deﬁned below and are printed in bold italic text.
Details of technical publications referred to in the text of this document are repeated as references in Appendix C. A reference to a publication is likely to be made for one of two main reasons.
"The publication may contain additional or more comprehensive technical detail, which it would be impractical to include in full in this Document but which is needed to fully explain ways of meeting the requirements; or it is a source of more general information."
The reason for the reference will be indicated in each case.
The reference will be to a speciﬁed edition of the document.
The Approved Document may be amended from time to time to include new references or to refer to revised editions where this aids compliance.
"If you do not understand the technical guidance or other information set out in this Approved Document and the additional detailed technical references to which it directs you, there are a number of routes through which you can seek further assistance:"
"If you are the person undertaking the building work you can seek assistance either from your local authority building control service or from your approved inspector (depending on which building control service you are using, or intend to use, to certify compliance of your work with the requirements of the Building Regulations)."
Businesses registered with a competent person self-certiﬁcation scheme may be able to get technical advice from their scheme operator.
"If your query is of a highly technical nature you may wish to seek the advice of a specialist, or industry technical body, in the area of concern."
"It is important to remember that if you are the person (e.g. designer, builder, installer) carrying out building work to which any requirement of Building Regulations applies you have a responsibility to ensure that the work complies with any such requirement."
The building owner may also have a responsibility for ensuring compliance with Building Regulation requirements and could be served with an enforcement notice in cases of non-compliance.
"This Approved Document deals with the sanitation, hot water safety and water efﬁciency requirements in the Building Regulations 2010."
"Limitation on requirements In accordance with regulation 8 of the Building Regulations, the requirements in Parts A to D, F to K and P (except for paragraphs G2, H2 and J7) of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations do not require anything to be done except for the purpose of securing reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about buildings (and any others who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings)."
Paragraph G2 is excluded from regulation 8 as it deals with the conservation of water.
Paragraphs H2 and J7 are excluded from regulation 8 because they deal directly with prevention of the contamination of water and of oil pollution.
"Parts E and M (which deal, respectively, with resistance to the passage of sound, and access to and use of buildings) are excluded from regulation 8 because they address the welfare and convenience of building users."
Part L is excluded from regulation 8 because it addresses the conservation of fuel and power.
"All these matters are amongst the purposes, other than health and safety, that may be addressed by Building Regulations."

Water-closet (WC) means a closet that has a separate ﬁxed receptacle connected to a drainage system and separate provision for ﬂushing from a supply of clean water either by the operation of a mechanism or by automatic action.
Water-closets are also referred to as WCs.
Wholesome water means water complying with the requirements of regulations made under Section 67 (Standards of wholesomeness) of the Water Industry Act 1991.
"The regulations made under this Section at the time of publication of this Approved Document are for England the Private Water Supplies Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/3101), for Wales the Private Water Supplies (Wales) Regulations (SI 2010/66) and, for England, the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/3184 as amended), and, for Wales, the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3911 as amended)."
"Building work, as deﬁned in regulation 3 of the Building Regulations 2010, includes the erection and extension of a building, the provision or extension of a controlled service or ﬁtting, and the material alteration of a building or a controlled service or ﬁtting."
"In addition, Building Regulations may apply in cases where the purposes for which or the manner or circumstances in which a building or part of a building is used change in a way that constitutes a material change of use."
"Under regulation 4 of the Building Regulations 2010, building work should be carried out in such a way that, on completion of work,"
"the building complies with the applicable Parts of Schedule 1 of the Building Regulations,"
"in the case of an extension or material alteration of a building, or the provision, extension or material alteration of a controlled service or ﬁtting, where it did not comply with any such requirement, it is no more unsatisfactory in relation to that requirement than before the work was carried out."
Work described in Part G concerns the provision or extension of controlled services or ﬁttings.
Work associated with installations covered in these sections may be subject to other relevant Parts of the Building Regulations.
A material change of use occurs in speciﬁed circumstances in which a building or part of a building that was previously used for one purpose will be used in future for another.
Where there is a material change of use the Building Regulations set requirements that must be met before the building can be used for its new purpose.
Regulation 5 of the Building Regulations speciﬁes the following circumstances as material changes of use:
a building is used as an hotel or boarding house where previously it was not.
"Parts G1, G3(1) to (3) and G4 to G6 will apply to all the material changes of use mentioned above."
This means that whenever such changes occur the building must be brought up to the standards required by Parts G1 and G3 to G6.
"Parts G2, G3(4) and regulation 36 will apply only to material changes of use where a building is used as a dwelling where previously it was not and where a building contains a ﬂat where previously it did not."
The types of building work covered by this Approved Document may include work on historic buildings.
Historic buildings include:
"buildings of architectural and historical interest within national parks, areas of outstanding or natural beauty and world heritage sites."
"Special considerations may apply if the building on which the work is to be carried out has special historic or architectural value, and compliance with the sanitation or hot water safety requirements would unacceptably alter the character or appearance of the building or parts of it."
"When undertaking work on or in connection with buildings with special historic or architectural value, the aim should be to improve sanitation and hot water safety where and to the extent that it is possible provided that the work does not prejudice the character of the host building or increase the risk of long-term deterioration to the building’s fabric or ﬁttings."
"In arriving at a balance between historic building conservation and sanitation or hot water safety requirements, it would be appropriate to take into account the advice of the local authority’s conservation ofﬁcer before work begins."
"Guidance is also available in the English Heritage publication Building Regulations and Historic Buildings, 2002 (revised 2004), which is available at www.english-heritage.org.uk."
Note: Any building in the schedule of monuments maintained under section 1 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 is exempt from all Building Regulations requirements including those in Part G.
Notiﬁcation of work In almost all cases of new building work it will be necessary to notify a BCB in advance of any work starting.
"certiﬁcation scheme listed in Schedule 3, and where work is listed in Schedule 4 to the Building Regulations as being not notiﬁable."
"relevant to the sanitation, hot water safety and water efﬁciency provisions of the Regulations are:"
Under regulation 12(6) of the Building Regulations it is not necessary to notify a BCB in advance of work which is covered by this Approved Document if that work is of a type set out in column 1 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations and is carried out by a person registered with a relevant self-certiﬁcation (competent persons) scheme as set out in column 2 of that Schedule.
"In order to join such a scheme a person must demonstrate competence to carry out the type of work the scheme covers, and also the ability to comply with all relevant requirements in the Building Regulations."
"Details of current schemes including those relating to sanitation, hot water safety and water efﬁciency can be found at www.gov.uk."
"These schemes may change from time to time, or schemes may change name, or new schemes may be authorised; so the current list on the website should always be consulted."
Full details of the schemes can be found on the individual scheme websites.
"Regulations 2010 require that the occupier of the building be given, within 30 days of the completion of the work, a certiﬁcate conﬁrming that the work complies with all applicable Building Regulation requirements."
"There is also a requirement that the BCB be given a notice that this has been done, or a copy of the certiﬁcate, again within 30 days of the completion of the work."
These certiﬁcates and notices are usually made available through the scheme operator.
BCBs are authorised to accept these certiﬁcates as evidence of compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.
"However, local authority inspection and enforcement powers remain unaffected, although they are normally used only in response to a complaint that work does not comply."
Schedule 4 to the Building Regulations sets out types of work where there is no requirement to notify a BCB that work is to be carried out.
"These types of work are mainly of a minor nature where there is no signiﬁcant risk to health, safety, water efﬁciency or energy efﬁciency."
"Health, safety, water efﬁciency and energy efﬁciency requirements continue to apply to these types of work; only the need to notify a BCB has been removed."
"Where only non-notiﬁable work as set out in Schedule 4 is carried out, there is no requirement for a certiﬁcate conﬁrming that the work complies with Building Regulation requirements to be given to the occupier or the BCB."
"The types of non-notiﬁable work in Schedule 4 i. in an existing hot water system, the replacement of any part which is not a combustion appliance, or the addition of an output device or control device."
"The work will however remain notiﬁable where commissioning is possible, and will affect the reasonable use of fuel and power."
"the installation of a stand-alone, self-contained ﬁxed hot water appliance."
"This is restricted to a single appliance and any associated controls and must not be connected to, or form part of, any other ﬁxed building service."
"However, if any of the following apply, the work will remain notiﬁable building work:"
"the replacement of a sanitary convenience with one that uses no more water than the one it replaces, a washbasin, sink, bidet, ﬁxed bath, or a shower but only where the work does not include any work to:"
providing a hot water storage system that has a storage vessel with a capacity not exceeding 15 litres provided that any electrical work associated with the installation is also not notiﬁable.
Schedule 4 also sets out what types of electrical installation work in dwellings is non-notiﬁable.
Full information on this is given in Approved Document P.
Schedule 2 to the Building Regulations sets out a number of classes of buildings which are exempt from all Building Regulations requirements.
"However, the exemption has been removed in respect of some requirements of Part G where hot or cold water supply systems are shared with other buildings."
This is to help ensure that the whole hot or cold water system is safe.
"the requirements of Parts G1, G3(2) and G3(3) will apply to any small detached building falling within Class 6 of Schedule 2 and any extension falling within Class 7 of Schedule 2 (which includes conservatories under 30m2 in area) which receives a hot or cold water supply shared with or located inside any building that is subject to the Regulations."
"Please note that the Regulations do not require the provision of hot or cold water systems to such exempt buildings, but if such systems are provided they must meet the minimum hygiene and safety requirements in those Parts."
Any building work which is subject to the requirements imposed by Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations shall be carried out in accordance with regulation 7. Guidance on meeting these requirements on materials and workmanship is contained in Approved Document 7.
"Building Regulations are made for specific purposes, primarily the health and safety, welfare and convenience of people and for energy conservation."
Standards and other technical specifications may provide relevant guidance to the extent that they relate to these considerations.
"However, they may also address other aspects of performance or matters which, although they relate to health and safety etc., are not covered by the Building Regulations."
"When an Approved Document makes reference to a named standard, the relevant version of the standard to which it refers is the one listed at the end of the publication."
"However, if this version has been revised or updated by the issuing standards body, the new version may be used as a source of guidance provided it continues to address the relevant requirements of the Regulations."
Supplementary guidance The Department for Communities and Local Government occasionally issues additional material to aid interpretation of the guidance in Approved Documents.
This material may be conveyed in ofﬁcial letters to chief executives of local authorities and Approved Inspectors and/or posted on the websites accessed through: www.gov.uk.
"This Approved Document makes reference to other legislation, including those listed below, that may also need to be considered."

"They make provision for the wholesomeness of water supplied for such domestic purposes as consist in or include cooking, drinking, food preparation or washing; or to premises in which food is produced."
"The Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/1148 as amended) are made under the Water Industry Act 1991 and apply to any water ﬁtting installed or used, or to be installed or used, in premises to which water is or is to be supplied by a water undertaker."
"They make provision for preventing contamination, waste, misuse, undue consumption and erroneous measurement of water supplied by a statutory water undertaker or licensed water supplier."
"The Private Water Supplies Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/3101) in England and The Private Water Supplies (Wales) Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/66) in Wales are made under the Water Industry Act 1991 and section 2(2) of the European Communications Act 1972 and are concerned with the quality of water supplied from private supplies for drinking, washing or cooking or for food preparation purposes."
"The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 (SI 1992/3004 as amended) are made under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and apply to any workplace or part of a workplace."
"They apply to the common parts of ﬂats and similar buildings if people such as cleaners, wardens and caretakers are employed to work in these common parts."
"They make provision for, amongst other matters, space requirements, cleaning and provision of sanitary conveniences."
Food Hygiene (England) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/14 as amended) and the Food Hygiene (Wales) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/31 W5 as amended) are made under European Communities Act 1972 and apply to measures relating to food (including drink) including the primary production of food.
The provision of washbasins and sinks is relevant to Approved Document G.
"Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations (SI 1998/2451) extend to all dangers arising from the transmission, distribution, supply or use of gas conveyed from a gas storage vessel."
The installation of gas heated water systems is relevant to Approved Document G.
This Approved Document deals with the following Requirement from Part G of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
There must be a suitable installation for the provision of:
wholesome water to any place where drinking water is drawn off;
wholesome water or softened wholesome water to any washbasin or bidet provided in or adjacent to a room containing a sanitary convenience;
"wholesome water or softened wholesome water to any washbasin, bidet, fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; and"
wholesome water to any sink provided in any area where food is prepared.
There must be a suitable installation for the provision of water of suitable quality to any sanitary convenience fitted with a flushing device.
In the Secretary of State’s view Requirement G1(1) will be met if:
the water supplied is wholesome;
the pressure and ﬂow rate is sufﬁcient for the operation of sanitary appliances planned in the building;
the supply is reliable; and
"the installation conveys wholesome water or softened wholesome water to the sanitary appliances and locations speciﬁed in the Requirement without waste, misuse, undue consumption or contamination of water."
The water will be wholesome if it is provided:
by a statutory water undertaker or a licensed water supplier; or
by a source complying with the Private Water Supplies Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/3101) in England or the Private Water Supplies (Wales) Regulations (SI 2010/66) in Wales.
In the Secretary of State’s view Requirement G1(2) will be met if:
"the water supplied is either wholesome, softened wholesome or of suitable quality having regard to the risks to health;"
the pressure and ﬂow rate is sufﬁcient for the operation of the sanitary appliances;
the supply is reliable; and
"the installation conveys water to sanitary appliances and locations speciﬁed in the Requirement without waste, misuse, undue consumption or contamination of wholesome water."
Water supplied to the building by a statutory water undertaker or a licensed water supplier through an installation complying with the requirements of the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/1148 as amended) may be assumed to be wholesome water.
The requirements in the appropriate water quality regulations are set out for ease of reference in Appendix B to this Approved Document.
"Attention is drawn to the requirements 1.2 of the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/1148 as amended) which make provision for preventing contamination, waste, misuse, undue consumption and erroneous measurement of water supplied by a water undertaker or licensed water supplier."
"Where a building is supplied with water from a source other than a water undertaker or licensed water supplier, the water shall be considered to be wholesome if it meets the criteria set out in the Private Water Supplies Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/3101) in England or the Private Water Supplies (Wales) Regulations (SI 2010/66) in Wales."
The requirements in those regulations are set out for ease of reference in Appendix B to this Approved Document.
Wholesome water which has been treated by a water softener or a water softening processes to adjust the content of hardness minerals may have raised levels of sodium.
"Where the water, after this treatment, still complies with the requirements for wholesome water it is still considered to be wholesome water."
"However, where it complies with all requirements for wholesome water other than its sodium content, it will be considered to be wholesome softened water."
Whilst wholesome softened water may be considered suitable for most purposes it should not be provided in place of wholesome water to any place where drinking water is drawn off or to any sink provided in an area where food is prepared.
"Water treated to the high standards of wholesome water is not essential for all of the uses that water is put to in and about buildings, e.g. toilet ﬂushing, irrigation."
A variety of alternative sources are available for water.
holes or water courses;
reclaimed greywater; and
reclaimed industrial process water.
The design of treatment systems for water from alternative sources should incorporate measures to minimise the impact on water quality of:
failure of any components;
failure to undertake any necessary maintenance;
power failure where appropriate; and
any other measures identiﬁed in a risk assessment.
Guidance on the marking of pipework conveying water from alternative sources can be found in the WRAS Information & Guidance Note No. 9-02-05 Marking and identiﬁcation of pipework for reclaimed (greywater) systems and in BS 8515:2009 Rainwater harvesting systems – Code of Practice.

"Guidelines for rainwater and greywater systems, in relation to water quality standards, can be found in MTP (2007) Rainwater and greywater: review of water quality standards alternative and recommendations for the UK."
"Water from alternative sources may be used in dwellings for sanitary conveniences, washing machines and irrigation, provided the appropriate risk assessment has been carried out."
"A risk assessment should ensure that the supply is appropriate to the situation in respect of the source of the water and the treatment of it, and not likely to cause waste, misuse, undue consumption or contamination of wholesome water."
"Any system/unit used to supply dwellings with water from alternative sources should be subject to a risk assessment by the system designer and manufacturer, and appropriate testing carried out to demonstrate that any risks have been suitably addressed."
A risk assessment should include consideration of the effect on water quality of system failure and failure to carry out necessary maintenance.
"This Approved Document deals with the following Requirement from Part G of Schedule 1 and regulation 36 to the Building Regulations 2010, as amended."
Reasonable provision must be made by the installation of fittings and fixed appliances that use water efficiently for the prevention of undue consumption of water.

a record of the alternative sources of water used in the water consumption calculation and supplied to the dwelling is provided along with sufﬁcient other information enabling building owners or occupiers to maintain the building and its services so as to maintain the water efﬁciency of the building.
Where a building consists of more than one dwelling (such as a block of ﬂats) it should be designed so that the estimated consumption of wholesome water resulting from the design of the cold and hot water systems for each individual dwelling should be no greater than the target.
and relevant white goods in a new dwelling should be calculated using the manufacturer’s declared value for water consumption of each of those appliances and white goods.
"The estimated water consumption of a 2.2 new dwelling should be calculated in accordance with the methodology set out in Appendix A, referred to as the water efﬁciency calculator."
The estimated consumption of 2.3 wholesome water of a new dwelling should be no more than 125 litres/person/day or 110 litres/person/day where the optional requirement applies.

"If they do, the water efﬁciency calculator must be completed to demonstrate compliance."
"Similarly, where a shower is not to be provided or where a waste disposal unit, a water softener or water re-use is to be provided the water efﬁciency calculator must be completed."
"Where the ﬁttings approach is used, the notice given under regulation 37 should state “Less than 125 litres/person/day using ﬁttings approach”."
Regulations require that a notice specifying the calculated potential consumption of wholesome water per person per day relating to the dwelling as constructed be given to the appropriate BCB.
"In most cases, this notice must be given 2.14 to the BCB no later than ﬁve days after the completion of the building work."
"However, where the BCB is an Approved Inspector and the dwelling is occupied before completion, the notice must be given no later than the day that the initial notice ceases to be in force in consequence of regulation 18 of the Building (Approved Inspectors etc) Regulations when this is earlier than ﬁve days after the completion of the work."
It is permissible for the notice to be served on the BCB electronically provided the BCB has stated its willingness to receive the document by those means and it is delivered to the electronic address that the body has speciﬁed.

"Further guidance is available in CIBSE Guide G, Public Health Engineering and CIBSE technical guide Solar Heating Design and Installation."
"Where solar water heating systems are used, an additional heat source should be available."
"Note: The additional heat source should be used, when necessary, to maintain the water temperature to restrict microbial growth."
"As some solar hot water systems operate at elevated temperatures and pressures, and so all components should be rated to the appropriate temperatures and pressures."
Safety devices such as temperature relief valves or combined temperature and pressure relief valves (see paragraphs 3.13 or 3.18) should discharge either directly or by way of a manifold via a short length of metal pipe (D1) to a tundish.
"The diameter of discharge pipe (D1) should be not less than the nominal outlet size of the safety device, e.g. temperature relief valve."
Where a manifold is used it should be sized to accept and discharge the total discharge from the discharge pipes connected to it.
"Where valves other than a temperature and pressure relief valve from a single unvented hot water system discharge by way of the same manifold that is used by the safety devices, the manifold should be factory ﬁtted as part of the hot water storage system unit or package."
"The tundish should be vertical, located in the same space as the unvented hot water storage system and be ﬁtted as close as possible to, and lower than, the safety device, with no more than 600mm of pipe between the valve outlet and the tundish (see Diagram 1)."
"Note: To comply with the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations, the tundish should incorporate a suitable air gap."
Any discharge should be visible at the tundish.
"In addition, where discharges from safety devices may not be apparent, e.g. in dwellings occupied by people with impaired vision or mobility, consideration should be given to the installation of a suitable safety device to warn when discharge takes place, e.g. electronically operated."
The discharge pipe (D2) from the tundish should:
have a vertical section of pipe at least 300mm long below the tundish before any elbows or bends in the pipework (see Diagram 1); and
be installed with a continuous fall of at least 1 in 200 thereafter.

The example below is for a G½ temperature relief valve with a discharge pipe (D2) having 4 No. 22mm elbows and length of 7m from the tundish to the point of discharge.
"Where a single common discharge pipe serves more than one system, it should be at least one pipe size larger than the largest individual discharge pipe (D2) to be connected."
"The discharge pipe should not be connected to a soil discharge stack unless it can be demonstrated that the soil discharge stack is capable of safely withstanding temperatures of the water discharged, in which case, it should:"
"contain a mechanical seal, not incorporating a water trap, which allows water into the branch pipe without allowing foul air from the drain to be ventilated through the tundish;"
be a separate branch pipe with no sanitary appliances connected to it;

be continuously marked with a warning that no sanitary appliances should be connected to the pipe.
"Plastic pipes should be joined and assembled with ﬁttings appropriate to the circumstances in which they are used as set out in Therefore the maximum permitted length equates to 5.8m which, is less than the actual length of 7m therefore calculate the next largest size."

The discharge pipe (D2) from the tundish should terminate in a safe place where there is no risk to persons in the vicinity of the discharge.
Examples of acceptable discharge arrangements are:
to a trapped gully with the end of the pipe below a ﬁxed grating and above the water seal;
"downward discharges at low level; i.e. up to 100mm above external surfaces such as car parks, hard standings, grassed areas etc. are acceptable providing that a wire cage or similar guard is positioned to prevent contact, whilst maintaining visibility; and,"
discharges at high level: e.g. into a metal hopper and metal downpipe with the end of the discharge pipe clearly visible or onto a roof capable of withstanding high temperature discharges of water and 3 m from any plastic guttering system that would collect such discharges.
The discharge would consist of high temperature water and steam.
"Asphalt, rooﬁng felt and non-metallic rainwater goods may be damaged by such discharges."
"Where the operating temperature of domestic hot water in the storage vessel in a dwelling is capable of exceeding 80°C under normal operating conditions (a situation that may occur in vessels used as heat stores and those connected to solar heat collectors or solid fuel boilers that do not have intervening controls between the boiler and the vessel containing the hot water) the outlet from the storage vessel should be ﬁtted with a device, such as an in-line hot water supply tempering valve in accordance with BS EN 15092:2008 Building Valves."
"In-line hot water tempering valves, to ensure that the temperature supplied to the domestic hot water distribution system does not exceed 60°C."
"The hot water supply temperature to a bath should be limited to a maximum of 48°C by use of an in-line blending valve or other appropriate temperature control device, with a maximum temperature stop and a suitable arrangement of pipework."
The acceptability of in-line blending valves can be demonstrated by compliance with the relevant European Standard such as BS EN 1111:1999 Sanitary tapware.
Thermostatic mixing valves (PN 10).
General technical speciﬁcation or BS EN 1287:1999 Sanitary tapware.
Low pressure thermostatic mixing valves.
General technical speciﬁcations to demonstrate that the maximum temperature of 48°C cannot be exceeded in operation and that the product will fail-safe (i.e. not discharge water above the maximum temperature).
Such valves should not be easily altered by building users.
In-line blending valves and composite thermostatic mixing valves should be compatible with the sources of hot and cold water that serve them.
The length of supply pipes between in-line blending valves and outlets should be kept to a minimum in order to prevent the colonisation of waterborne pathogens.
"If intermittent use of the bath is anticipated, provision should be made for high temperature ﬂushing to allow pasteurisation of the pipes and outlet ﬁttings."
Such events should be managed to prevent the risk associated with inadvertent use.
Good workmanship is essential.
Workmanship should be in accordance with appropriate standards such as BS 8000–15:1990 Workmanship on Building Sites Code of practice for hot and cold water services (domestic scale).
Water heaters require the input of energy to raise the temperature of water.
It is therefore necessary to ensure their efﬁciency by proper installation and commissioning.
"Fixed building services, including controls, should be commissioned by testing and adjusting as necessary to ensure that they use no more fuel and power than is reasonable in the circumstances."
"work, regulation (that is testing and adjusting repetitively) to achieve the speciﬁed performance, the calibration, setting up and testing of the associated automatic control systems, and recording of systems and the performance test results that have been accepted as satisfactory."
Not all ﬁxed building services will need to be commissioned.
"For example, with some systems it is not possible as the only controls are ‘on’ and ‘off’ settings."
In other cases commissioning would be possible but in the speciﬁc circumstances would have no effect on energy use.
Where commissioning is carried out it must be done in accordance with a procedure approved by the Secretary of State.
For new and existing dwellings the approved procedure for hot water systems is set out in the Domestic Heating Compliance Guide; for buildings other than dwellings in CIBSE Commissioning Code M.
Commissioning must be carried out in such a way as not to prejudice compliance with any applicable health and safety requirements.
Commissioning is often carried out by the person who installs the system.
Sometimes it may be carried out by a subcontractor or by a specialist ﬁrm.
It is important that whoever carries it out follows the relevant approved procedure in doing so.
"Regulations (regulation 20(1) and (6)) require that the person carrying out the work shall give a notice to the relevant BCB that commissioning has been carried out according to a procedure approved by the Secretary of State, unless testing and adjustment is not possible, or would not affect the energy efﬁciency of the ﬁxed building service."
"Where the work is carried out in accordance with a building notice, or full plans, or an initial notice or amendment notice, the notice of commissioning should be given not more than 5 days after the completion of the commissioning work."
"In other cases, for example where work is carried out by a person registered with a competent person scheme, it must be given not more than 30 days after the completion of work."
Where the installation of ﬁxed building services which require commissioning is carried out by a person registered with a competent person scheme the notice of commissioning will be given by that person.
Until the BCB receives notice of commissioning it is unlikely to be satisﬁed that Part G has been complied with and consequently is unlikely to be able to give a completion/ﬁnal certiﬁcate.

calculation methodology for assessing the whole house potable water consumption in new dwellings.
The calculation methodology is to be used to assess compliance against the water performance targets in Regulation 36 as set out below.
It is not a design tool for water supply and drainage systems.
It is also not capable of calculating the actual potable water consumption of a new dwelling.
Behaviour and changing behaviour can also have an effect on the amount of potable water used throughout a home.
The calculation methodology requires A2 the use of water consumption ﬁgures provided from manufacturers’ product details.
"Before the assessment can be carried out, ﬁgures will need to be collected from manufacturers’ product information to determine the consumption of each terminal ﬁtting, including:"
Flushing capacity for the WC suite including consumption at full and part ﬂush for dual ﬂush WCs.
"Where multiple WCs are speciﬁed with various ﬂushing capacities, the average effective ﬂushing volume must be used as set out in paragraphs A8 and A11."
"Bidets are excluded from the water efﬁciency calculator for new dwellings due to their minimal water consumption, and although there is insufﬁcient research to quantify this consumption, anecdotal evidence shows that there is evidence that bidets often displace other water consumption rather than increase consumption."
"Flow rate of each tap, at full ﬂow rate in litres per minute measured at a dynamic pressure of 3±0.2 bar (0.3±0.02 MPa) for high pressure (Type 1) taps, or at a dynamic pressure of 0.1±0.02 bar (0.01±0.002 MPa) for low pressure (Type 2) taps (BS EN 200:2008, sanitary tapware, single taps and combination taps for supply systems of type 1 and 2. General technical speciﬁcations) including any reductions achieved with ﬂow restrictions."
Where multiple taps are to be provided (e.g. separate hot and cold taps) the ﬂow rate of each tap will be needed in order to calculate an average ﬂow rate in accordance with paragraphs A8 to A10.
"For ‘click taps’ and other taps with a ‘water break’, the manufacturer’s stated full ﬂow rate should be used to perform calculations (measured as described above)."
Do not use the ﬂow rate at the break point.
A factor for percentage of ﬂow rate is already assumed within the use factor for taps.
There is currently no research to provide a separate use factor for ‘click taps’ so a standard use factor is applied.
Taps on baths should not be included in the calculation as the water consumption from bath taps is taken account of in the use factor for baths.
"Total capacity of the bath to overﬂow, in litres (excluding displacement, this is already included in the use factor for baths)."
"Where multiple baths are speciﬁed with various capacities, the average must be used as set out in paragraphs A8 to A10."
Spa hot tubs are not included in the water efﬁciency calculator as they are generally not ﬁlled on a daily basis and their water consumption over a year is minimal.
"Litres per place setting derived from the value quoted on the EU Energy Label, i.e. annual water use (cid:56)(cid:3)(280(cid:3)(cid:61)(cid:3)number of place settings)."
"Where no dishwasher is to be provided and therefore consumption ﬁgures are unknown, a ﬁgure of 1.25 litres per place setting must be assumed."
"Where multiple dishwashers are speciﬁed with various consumptions, the average must be used as set out in paragraphs A8 to A10."
capacity in kg).
"Where no washing machine is to be provided and therefore consumption ﬁgures are unknown, a ﬁgure of 8.17 litres per kilogram must be assumed."
"Where multiple washing machines are speciﬁed with various consumptions, the average must be used as set out in paragraphs A8 to A10."
"Flow rate of each shower at the outlet using cold water (T (cid:41) 30˚C), in litres per minute measured at a dynamic pressure of 3±0.2 bar (0.3±0.02 MPa) for high pressure (Type 1) supply systems, or at a dynamic pressure of 0.1±0.05 bar (0.01±0.005 MPa) for low pressure (Type 2) supply systems (BS EN 1112:2008, Sanitary tapware."
Shower outlets for sanitary tapware for water supply systems type 1 and 2. General technical speciﬁcations).

Percentage of total capacity used per regeneration cycle.
Water consumed per regeneration cycle (litres).
Average number of regeneration cycles per day.
Number of occupants (based on two occupants in the ﬁrst bedroom and one occupant per additional bedroom assuming two occupants in studio ﬂats).
"Water softeners that do not have a water consumption such as electromagnetic types, are not included in the calculation."
"Where present, a standard consumption of 3.08 litres per person per day must be assumed."
Flow rates of external taps are not included in the calculation as a ﬁxed allowance of ﬁve litres per person per day is assumed for external water use.
In some cases rainwater harvesting and A3 greywater recycling may be used as a means of reducing water consumption to achieve higher water efﬁciency performance levels.
have been maximised and further savings are still needed:
"Manufacturer or system designer details on the percentage of used water to be recycled, taking into account the storage capacity of the system."
"The volume of recycled water collected from waste bath, shower and washhand basin, dishwasher and washing machine usage, with the volume collected calculated in accordance with Table A1 or Tables A4.3, A4.4 and A4.5."
and A4.2 where greywater is just being used in a proportion of ﬁttings.
Daily non-potable water demand
Large water consuming installations such as swimming pools and spa hot tubs where the water is replaced over a greater time interval do not need to be included as part of the water calculations.
details should be entered into Table A1 to calculate the consumption of each ﬁtting in litres per person per day.
"Where there are multiple ﬁttings of the same type that have various ﬂow rates or capacities (e.g. hot and cold taps with different ﬂow rates), Tables A2.1 to A2.7 should be used to determine the average ﬂow rate or capacity of such ﬁttings."
The consumption of water softeners in litres per person per day is calculated using Table A3.
"All values throughout the water efﬁciency calculator should be rounded to two decimal places with the exception of the total water consumption ﬁgures, which should be rounded to one decimal place."
"The total calculated use, resulting from Table A1, is the total consumption of all water consuming ﬁttings per person."
"To calculate the litres of water consumed per person per day, any savings from grey or rainwater need to be deducted from the total calculated use using ﬁgures from Tables A4.6 and A5.5."
The litres/person/day ﬁgure is then multiplied by a normalisation factor to determine the total water consumption per person.
"To calculate the total water consumption, an additional allowance for external water use is added on to the total water consumption."
This ﬁgure is set at 5 litres/person/day.
Table A1: The water efﬁciency calculator
"Where terminal ﬁttings with varying ﬂow rates and capacities are speciﬁed (e.g. hot and cold taps with different ﬂow rates, two types of shower etc.), the average consumption should be calculated as set out in Tables A2.1 to A2.7:"
Enter the full ﬂow rate or volume of each type of ﬁtting into column (a) of the relevant table.
"For taps, where there are separate hot and cold water taps, the ﬂow rate of each tap should be entered separately as two tap types to calculate the average ﬂow rate."
Calculate the total consumption per ﬁtting type.
Calculate the average ﬂow rate/volume of the ﬁttings detailed.
"Enter the ﬂow rate/volume of the ﬁtting with the highest ﬂow rate/volume into box (f) with the exception of WCs, where this step is not relevant."
"Calculate the proportionate ﬂow rate/volume by multiplying the highest ﬂow rate/volume by a factor of 0.7 with the exception of WCs, where this step is not relevant."
"Where the average ﬂow rate/volume is lower than the proportionate ﬂow rate/volume, the proportionate ﬁgure must be entered into Table A1."
"volume down, where such ultra low ﬁttings may not be acceptable to dwellings occupants."
The ﬁgure which is the greater of the average or proportionate ﬂow rate/volume should be used.
"This is so that, where the average ﬂow rate/volume is signiﬁcantly lower than the highest ﬂow rate/volume speciﬁed, the calculation sets a limitation for what ﬁgure can be assumed."
"Where more than one type of WC is provided, the average effective ﬂushing volume is calculated using Table A2.7 below."
The average effective ﬂush volume should then be entered into Table A1 in the row ‘WCs (multiple ﬁttings)’.
Ion exchange water softeners use A12 water in order to clean the resin that is used to absorb the mineral content of the dwelling’s water supply.
"This cleaning process is referred to as the regeneration cycle, which occurs on a frequency dependent on the type of water softener speciﬁed and the hardness of the water."
The water efﬁciency calculator looks at the water consumed per regeneration cycle that is beyond a level of good practice.
The good practice level has been determined at a level of water consumption as a percentage of the water softener’s total capacity which is set at 4 per cent.
The ﬁgure entered into the calculator is the volume of water consumed beyond this level of good practice to promote the use of more efﬁcient water softeners.
"Where the water softener achieves a percentage that is equal to, or lower than this good practice benchmark ﬁgure, zero can be entered into Table A1 of the calculator for water softeners."
The following formula is used to determine the litres of water consumed per person per day that is beyond the good practice level of 4 per cent.
Litres of water consumed per person per day beyond the 4 per cent good practice level:
the total capacity is the volume of water that ﬂows through the water softener between regeneration cycles.
This volume is dependent on the hardness of the water and the total capacity used in this calculation needs to reﬂect the hardness of water speciﬁc to the geographic location of the speciﬁc development.
This ﬁgure should be determined from manufacturer’s product details.
"To calculate the litres of water consumed per person per day beyond the 4 per cent good practice level, enter details of the water softener into Table A3."
"Where the result indicates zero or a negative ﬁgure, zero should be entered into Table A1 for water softeners."
The number of occupants entered into the table should be based on two in the ﬁrst bedroom and one in each additional room.
Studio ﬂats should assume for two occupants.
"Where all WCs and/or washing machines are being supplied with greywater, the consumption values should be copied from Column 4 of Table A1 and entered into Table A4.6 to calculate the greywater savings."
"Where greywater is only being supplied to a proportion of ﬁttings such as just to one WC or washing machine, the proportion is calculated by entering details into Tables A4.1 and A4.2."
Total greywater demand
Average greywater demand from washing machines (f) Total greywater demand
"Where greywater is to be collected from all ﬁttings including the shower, bath and wash hand basin taps, the total water consumption of the ﬁttings calculated in Table A1 represents the total greywater collected, the sum of the consumption ﬁgures for ﬁttings from which greywater is collected (from column 4 of Table A1) should be entered into Table A4.6."
"Where greywater is only being collected from a proportion of ﬁttings, such as just some of the taps, the calculations in Tables A4.3 to A4.5 should be followed and the results entered into Table A4.6."
"Where greywater is to be reused within the dwelling, the savings from greywater can be calculated by entering the following details into Table A4.6:"
Calculate the water to be recycled from Table A1 and/or using the method set out in section A18 where just a proportion of ﬁttings are being collected from.
Determine the percentage of greywater collected to be recycled based upon manufacturer or system designer details of the system speciﬁed.
Determine the water demand of the ﬁttings to be provided with greywater which can include WCs and washing machines depending on the quality of the treated water.
and A4.2 in paragraphs A16 and A17.
Multiply the volume of water to be recycled with the percentage of recycled water (determined in b. above) which will determine the actual volume of greywater available.
"Where the greywater supply is greater than the demand, the greywater savings are equal to the demand."
"Where the demand is greater than the greywater supply, the savings are equal to the supply."
Enter the greywater saving ﬁgure from Table A4.6 into Table A1.
(from Table A1 or
"Where (c) is greater than (d), (e) = (d),"
to A4.5 can be used in the same way.
The ﬁgures entered into Table A4.6 need to be entered on an individual dwelling basis and not using ﬁgures to reﬂect the communal system as a whole.
"The percentage collected ﬁgure will, however, need to be based on manufacturer or system designer details of the communal system speciﬁed."
"Where rainwater is to be used, the following calculation method should be followed by entering the relevant details into Table A5.1 or Table A5.2 to calculate the rainwater collection volume."
For Table A5.1 using the intermediate approach from BS 8515:
"Calculate the volume of water collected using the collection area, yield coefﬁcient and hydraulic ﬁlter efﬁciency and average rainfall with guidance from BS 8515."
"Calculate the daily rainwater collection in box (d) using the collection area, yield coefﬁcient, hydraulic ﬁlter efﬁciency and rainfall."
"Enter the number of occupants into box (e), which can be based on two occupants in the ﬁrst bedroom and one occupant in each additional bedroom."
A studio ﬂat should assume two occupants.
"Where a communal rainwater system is to be provided supplying more than one home, Table A5.1 can be used in the same way calculating the total volume collected for the communal system and dividing it by the total number of occupants served by the system."
This ﬁgure should then be entered in Table A5.5.
"Number of occupants (f) Daily rainwater per person (litres) = [(d)/(e)] A23 For Table A5.2 using the detailed approach as described in BS 8515, enter details of the total daily rainwater collection (litres) and the number of occupants to calculate the daily rainwater per person (litres) and enter into Table A5.5."
Daily rainwater collection (litres) (b) Number of occupants (c) Daily rainwater per person (litres) = [(a)/(b)] A24 The calculation detailed above in Table A5.2 is sufﬁcient for evaluating the principles of the proposed system in the proposed development.
"However, for sizing of storage capacity and all other design and installation details, BS 8515 should be followed."
"Where all WCs and/or washing machines are being supplied with rainwater, the consumption should be taken from Table A1 and entered into Table A5.5 to calculate the rainwater savings."
"Where rainwater is only being supplied to a proportion of ﬁttings, such as just to one WC or washing machine, the proportion is calculated using Table A5.3 and A5.4."
This rainwater demand can then be entered into Table A5.5 to calculate the rainwater savings.

This document is one of a series that has been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of Schedule 1 to and Regulation 7 of the Building Regulations 2010 (SI 2010/2214) for England and Wales.
At the back of this document is a list of all the documents that have been approved and issued by the Secretary of State for this purpose.
Approved Documents are intended to provide guidance for some of the more common building situations.
"However, there may well be alternative ways of achieving compliance with the requirements."
Thus there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution contained in an Approved Document if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way.
The guidance contained in an Approved Document relates only to the particular requirements of the Regulations which the document addresses.
The building work will also have to comply with the requirements of any other relevant paragraphs in Schedule 1 to the Regulations.
There are Approved Documents which give guidance on each of the Parts of Schedule 1 and on Regulation 7.
"In accordance with Regulation 8, the requirements in Parts A to K and N (except for paragraphs H2 and J6) of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations do not require anything to be done except for the purpose of securing reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about buildings (and any others who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings)."
Paragraphs H2 and J7 are excluded from Regulation 8 because they deal directly with prevention of the contamination of water.
Parts L and M are excluded because they respectively address the conservation of fuel and power and access and facilities for disabled people.
"These matters are amongst the purposes, other than health and safety, that may be addressed by Building Regulations."
Any building work which is subject to the requirements imposed by Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations shall be carried out in accordance with regulation 7. Guidance on meeting these requirements on materials and workmanship is contained in Approved Document 7.
"Building Regulations are made for specific purposes, primarily the health and safety, welfare and convenience of people and for energy conservation."
Standards and other technical specifications may provide relevant guidance to the extent that they relate to these considerations.
"However, they may also address other aspects of performance or matters which, although they relate to health and safety etc., are not covered by the Building Regulations."
"When an Approved Document makes reference to a named standard, the relevant version of the standard to which it refers is the one listed at the end of the publication."
"However, if this version has been revised or updated by the issuing standards body, the new version may be used as a source of guidance provided it continues to address the relevant requirements of the Regulations."
"The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 contain some requirements which affect building design."
"The main requirements are now covered by the Building Regulations, but for further information see Workplace health, safety and welfare."

Approved Code of Practice L24.
Published by HSE Books 1992 (ISBN 0 7176 0413 6).
"The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 apply to the common parts of flats and similar buildings if people such as cleaners and caretakers are employed to work in these common parts."
"Where the requirements of the Building Regulations that are covered by this Part do not apply to dwellings, the provisions may still be required in the situations described above in order to satisfy the Workplace Regulations."
Laying and maintaining drains are hazardous operations.
Appropriate safety codes should be followed including procedures for working in confined spaces.
Safe working procedures and permits to work may be required in some situations.
"Relevant statutory requirements can be found in the Construction (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1996, SI 1996/1592, the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 1994, SI 1994/3140 and the Confined Spaces Regulations 1997, SI 1997/1713."

"An adequate system of drainage shall be provided to carry foul water from appliances within the building to one of the following, listed in order of priority:"
"Requirement H1 does not apply to the diversion of water which has been used for personal washing or for the washing of clothes, linen or other articles to collection systems for re-use."
"a public sewer; or, where that is not reasonably practicable,"
"a private sewer communicating with a public sewer; or, where that is not reasonably practicable,"
"either a septic tank which has an appropriate form of secondary treatment or another wastewater treatment system; or, where that is not reasonably practicable,"
In this Part ‘foul water’ means waste water which comprises or includes:
"waste from a sanitary convenience, bidet or appliance used for washing receptacles for foul waste; or"
"water which has been used for food preparation, cooking or washing."
In the Secretary of State’s view the requirement of H1 will be met if a foul water drainage system:
enough to carry the expected flow at any point.
"The capacity of the system should be large a. conveys the flow of foul water to a foul water outfall (a foul or combined sewer, a cesspool, septic tank or holding tank);"
The capacity depends on the size and 0.2 gradient of the pipes.
Minimum sizes and gradient limits are given in the text.
minimises the risk of blockage or leakage;
prevents foul air from the drainage system from entering the building under working conditions;
is accessible for clearing blockages; and
does not increase the vulnerability of the building to flooding.
The pipe sizes quoted in this document are 0.3 nominal sizes used as a numerical designation in convenient round numbers approximately equal to a manufacturer’s size.
"Equivalent pipe sizes for individual pipe standards will be found in the standards listed in Tables 4, 7 and 14."
The provisions in this section are applicable 1.1 to domestic buildings and small non-domestic buildings.
Further guidance on larger buildings is given in Appendix A. Complex systems in larger buildings should be designed in accordance with BS EN 12056 (see paragraph 1.39).
The guidance in these provisions is 1.2 applicable for WCs with major flush volumes of 5 litres or more.
"Where WCs with major flush volumes less than 5 litres are used, consideration should be given to the increased risk of blockages."
Guidance on the design of sanitary pipework suitable for use with WCs with major flush volumes as low as 4 litres can be found in BS EN 12056 (see paragraph 1.39).
All points of discharge into the system 1.3 should be fitted with a trap (e.g. a water seal trap) to prevent foul air from the system entering the building.
Under working and test conditions traps should retain a minimum seal of 25mm of water or equivalent.
Table 1 gives minimum trap sizes and seal 1.4 depths for the appliances which are most used (for other appliances see Appendix paragraph A4).
Pressure fluctuation – To prevent the water seal from being broken by the pressures which can develop in the system the branch discharge pipes should be designed as described in paragraphs 1.7 to 1.25.
Access for clearing blockages – If a trap forms part of an appliance the appliance should be removable.
All other traps should be fitted directly after the appliance and should be removable or be fitted with a cleaning eye.
The depth of seal may be reduced to 50mm only with flush grated wastes without plugs on spray tap basins.
Where these appliances discharge directly to a gully the depth of seal may be reduced to not less than 38mm.
Traps used on appliances with flat bottom (trailing waste discharge) and discharging to a gully with a grating may have a reduced water seal of not less than 38mm.
Branch pipes should discharge into another branch pipe or a discharge stack unless the appliances discharge to a gully.
"Gullies are generally at ground floor level, but may be at basement level."
Branch pipes should not discharge into open hoppers.
"If the appliances are on the ground floor 1.8 the pipe(s) may discharge to a stub stack or discharge stack, directly to a drain or (if the pipe carries only wastewater) to a gully."
A branch pipe from a ground floor closet 1.9 should only discharge directly to a drain if the depth from the floor to the drain is 1.3m or less (see Diagram 1).
A branch pipe should not discharge into a stack in a way which could cause crossflow into any other branch pipe.
A branch discharge pipe should not discharge into a stack lower than 450mm above the invert of the tail of the bend at the foot of the stack in single dwellings of up to 3 storeys (see Diagram 2).
Branch pipes may discharge into a stub stack.
A branch pipe discharging to a gully should terminate between the grating or sealing plate and the top of the water seal.
Condensate drainage from boilers may be connected to sanitary pipework.
The connection should be made using pipework of minimum diameter 22mm through a 75mm condensate trap.
"If an additional trap is provided externally to the boiler to provide the 75mm seal, an air gap should be provided between the boiler and the trap."
The connection should preferably be made to an internal stack with a 75mm condensate trap.
"If the connection is made to a branch pipe, the connection should be made downstream of any sink waste connection."
All sanitary pipework receiving condensate should be made from materials resistant to a pH value of 6.5 and lower.
The installation should be in accordance with BS 6798.
Sizes of branch pipes – Pipes serving a single appliance should have at least the same diameter as the appliance trap (see Table 1).
"If a pipe serves more than one appliance, and is unventilated, the diameter should be at least the size shown in Table 2."
Bends in branch pipes should be avoided if possible.
Where they cannot they should have as large a radius as possible.
Junctions on branch pipes of about the same diameter should be made with a sweep of 25mm radius or at 45°.
Connection of branch pipes of 75mm diameter or more to a stack of equal diameter should be made with a sweep of 50mm minimum radius or at 45°.
"Branch pipes up to 40mm diameter joining branch pipes 100mm diameter or greater should, if practicable, connect to the upper part of the pipe wall of the larger branch."
Ventilation of branch pipes – separate ventilation will not be needed to prevent the water seals in traps from being lost by pressures which can develop in the system if the length and slope of the branch discharge pipes do not exceed those shown in Table 2 or Diagram 3.
Appliance WC outlet > 80mm WC outlet < 80mm Urinal – bowl Urinal – trough Urinal – slab Washbasin or bidet Max.
Should be as short as possible to prevent deposition.
"May be reduced to 9mm on long drain runs where space is restricted, but only if more than one WC is connected."
"Not recommended where disposal of sanitary towels may take place via the WC, as there is an increased risk of blockages."
Slab urinals longer than seven persons should have more than one outlet.
Approved Document H Drainage and waste disposalONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 3 storeys discharge stacks should be located inside the building.
Sizes of stacks – Stacks should have at least the diameter shown in Table 3 and should not reduce in the direction of flow.
"Stacks serving urinals should be not less than 50mm, stacks serving closets with outlets less than 80mm should be not less than 75mm and stacks serving closets with outlets greater than 80mm should be not less than 100mm."
The internal diameter of the stack should be not less than that of the largest trap or branch discharge pipe.
For larger buildings the maximum flow should be checked.
† Not more than 1 WC with outlet size <80mm.
"Ventilation of discharge stacks – To prevent water seals in the traps from being lost by pressures which can develop in the system, discharge stacks should be ventilated."
Discharge stacks connected to drains liable to surcharging or near an intercepting trap require ventilating pipes of not less than 50mm diameter connected to the base of the stack above the likely flood level.
Stub stacks – A stub stack may be used if it connects into a ventilated discharge stack or into a ventilated drain not subject to surcharging and no connected water closet has a floor level more than 1.3m and no other branch into the stub stack has a centreline more than 2m to the centre line above the invert of the connection or drain (see Diagram 5).
"If the figures in Table 2 and Diagram 3 are 1.20 exceeded the branch pipe should be ventilated by a branch ventilating pipe to external air, to a ventilating stack (ventilated branch system) or internally by use of an air admittance valve."
A separate ventilating stack is only likely to be preferred where the numbers of sanitary appliances and their distance to a discharge stack are large.
"Branch ventilating pipes – should be connected to the discharge pipe within 750mm of the trap and should connect to the ventilating stack or the stack vent, above the highest ‘spillover’ level of the appliances served (see Diagram 4)."
The ventilating pipe should have a continuous incline from the discharge pipe to the point of connection to the ventilating stack or stack vent.
Branch ventilating pipes which run direct to outside air should finish at least 900mm above any opening into the building nearer than 3m (see Diagram 6 and paragraph 1.31).
"Branch ventilating pipes to branch pipes serving one appliance should be at least 25mm diameter or where the branch is longer than 15m or has more than 5 bends, should be at least 32mm."
Rodding points should be provided to give access to any lengths of discharge pipe which cannot be reached by removing traps or appliances with internal traps (see paragraph 1.6).
All stacks should discharge to a drain.
The bend at the foot of the stack should have as large a radius as possible and at least 200mm at the centre line.
Offsets in the ‘wet’ portion of a discharge stack should be avoided.
If they are unavoidable then in a building of not more than 3 storeys there should be no branch connection within 750mm of the offset.
In a building over 3 storeys a ventilation stack may be needed with connections above and below the offset.
"Ventilating pipes open to outside air should finish at least 900mm above any opening into the building within 3m and should be finished with a wire cage or other perforated cover, fixed to the end of the ventilating pipe, which does not restrict the flow of air (see Diagram 6)."
In areas where rodent control is a problem (see paragraph 2.22) these should be metallic.
"Sizes of stack ventilation pipes – stack ventilation pipes (the dry part above the highest branch) may be reduced in size in one and two storey houses, but should be not less than 75mm."
Ventilated discharge stacks may be terminated inside a building when fitted with air admittance valves complying with BS EN 12380:2002.
Where these valves are used they should not adversely affect the amount of ventilation necessary for the below ground system which is normally provided by open stacks of the sanitary pipework.
"adequate ventilation, should be accessible for maintenance and should be removable to give access for clearance of blockages."
Air admittance valves should not be used outside buildings or in dust laden atmospheres.
"Where there is no open ventilation on a drainage system or through connected drains, alternative arrangements to relieve positive pressures should be considered."
Access for clearing blockages – rodding points should be provided in discharge stacks to give access to any lengths of pipe which cannot be reached from any other part of the system.
All pipes should be reasonably accessible for repair.
Rodding points in stacks should be above the spillover level of appliances.
Any of the materials shown in Table 4 may be used (the references are to British Standard or European Standard Specifications).
Where necessary different metals should be separated by non-metallic material to prevent electrolytic corrosion.
Care should be taken to ensure continuity of any electrical earth bonding requirements.
Pipes should be firmly supported without restricting thermal movement.
Attention is also drawn to the requirement of Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2000 and guidance in the Approved Document relating to penetration of fire separating elements and fire stopping provisions.
Note: Some of these materials may not be suitable for carrying trade effluent or condensate from boilers.
"Sanitary pipework connected to WCs should not allow light to be visible through the pipe wall, as this is believed to encourage damage by rodents."
Good workmanship is essential.
Workmanship should be in accordance with BS 8000 Workmanship on Building Sites Part 13: Code of practice for above ground drainage.
"The pipes, fittings and joints should be capable of withstanding an air test of positive pressure of at least 38mm water gauge for at least 3 minutes."
Every trap should maintain a water seal of at least 25mm.
Smoke testing may be used to identify defects where a water test has failed.
Smoke testing is not recommended for PVC-U pipes.
The requirement can also be met by following the relevant recommendations of BS EN 12056 Gravity drainage systems inside buildings.
"Relevant clauses are in Part 1: General and performance requirements, Clauses 3–6; Part 2 Sanitary pipework, layout and calculation, Clauses 3 to 6 and National Annexes NA to NG (System III is traditionally in use in the UK); Part 5 Installation and testing, instructions for operation, maintenance and use, Clauses 4–6, 8, 9 and 11."
BS EN 12109 Vacuum Drainage Systems Inside Buildings.
This section gives guidance on the 2.1 construction of underground drains and sewers from buildings to the point of connection to an existing sewer or a cesspool or wastewater treatment system and includes any drains or sewers outside the curtilage of the building.
Disused and defective pipework is known to harbour rats (see Appendix H1-B).
Some public sewers may carry foul water 2.2 and rainwater in the same pipes.
"If the drainage system is also to carry rainwater to such a sewer, the following provisions still apply but the pipe sizes may need to be increased to carry the combined flows (see paragraph 2.35)."
"In some circumstances, separate drainage should still be provided (see Approved Document H5)."
Foul drainage should be connected to a 2.3 public foul or combined sewer wherever this is reasonably practicable.
For small developments connection should be made to a public sewer where this is within 30m provided that the developer has the right to construct the drainage over any intervening private land.
Where levels do not permit drainage by gravity a pumping installation should be provided (see paragraphs 2.36 to 2.39).
For larger developments it may be economic 2.4 to connect to a public sewer even where the sewer is some distance away.
"For developments comprising more than one curtilage, the developer may requisition a sewer from the sewerage undertaker who has powers to construct sewers over private land (see Appendix H1-C, C.4)."
"The sewerage undertaker should be 2.5 notified at least three weeks before it is intended to connect to the public sewer (see Appendix H1-C, C.7)."
"Where it is not reasonably practicable to connect to a public sewer, it may be possible to connect to an existing private sewer that connects with a public sewer."
The permission of the owner or owners of the sewer will be required.
The sewer should be in satisfactory condition and have sufficient capacity to take the additional flows.
"Where none of these options is reasonably practicable, a wastewater treatment system or cesspool should be provided (see Approved Document H2)."
Combined and rainwater sewers are designed to surcharge (i.e. the water level in the manhole rises above the top of the pipe) in heavy rainfall.
Some foul sewers also receive rainwater and therefore surcharge.
For low-lying sites (where the ground level of the site or the level of a basement is below the ground level at the point where the drainage connects to the public sewer) care should be taken to ensure that the property is not at increased risk of flooding.
In all such cases the sewerage undertaker should be consulted to determine the extent and possible frequency of the likely surcharge.
"For basements containing sanitary 2.9 appliances, where the risk of flooding due to surcharge of the sewer is considered by the sewerage undertaker to be high, the drainage from the basement should be pumped (see paragraphs 2.36 to 2.39)."
Where the risk is considered to be low an anti-flooding valve should be installed on the drainage from the basement.
"For other low-lying sites (i.e. not basements) where risk is considered low, sufficient protection for the building may be possible by provision of a gully outside the building at least 75mm below the floor level."
This should be positioned so that any flooding from the gully will not damage any buildings.
"In higher risk areas an anti-flooding valve should be provided, or the drainage system pumped (see paragraph 2.36 to 2.39)."
#NAME?
They should comply with the requirements of prEN 13564.
A single valve should not normally serve more than one building.
A notice should be provided inside the building to indicate that the system is drained through such a valve.
"This notice should also indicate the location of any manual override, and include advice on necessary maintenance."
All drainage unaffected by surcharge should by-pass the protective measures and discharge by gravity.
The layout of the drainage system should be kept simple.
Changes of direction and gradient should be minimised and as easy as practicable.
Access points should be provided only if blockages could not be cleared without them.
"Connection of drains to other drains or private or public sewers, and of private sewers to public sewers, should be made obliquely, or in the direction of flow."
Connections should be made using prefabricated components.
Where holes are cut in pipes a drilling device should be used to avoid damaging the pipe.
"Where connections made to existing drains or sewers involve removal of pipes and insertion of a junction, repair couplings should be used to ensure a watertight joint and the junction should be carefully packed to avoid differential settlement with adjacent pipes."
"Sewers (serving more than one property) should be kept as far as is practicable away from the point on a building where a future extension is likely (e.g. rear of a house, or side of house where there is room for a side extension)."
The system should be ventilated by a flow of air.
A ventilating pipe should be provided at or near the head of each main drain.
"An open ventilating pipe (without an air admittance valve) should be provided on any drain fitted with an intercepting trap (particularly on a sealed system), and on any drain subject to surcharge."
Ventilated discharge stacks may be used (see paragraphs 1.27 and 1.29).
Ventilating pipes should not finish near openings in buildings (see paragraph 1.31).
Pipes should be laid to even gradients and any change of gradient should be combined with an access point (see paragraph 2.49).
Pipes should also be laid in straight lines where practicable but may be laid to slight curves if these can still be cleared of blockages.
Any bends should be limited to positions in or close to inspection chambers or manholes (see paragraph 2.49) and to the foot of discharge and ventilating stacks.
Bends should have as large a radius as practicable.
Drainage serving kitchens in commercial hot food premises should be fitted with a grease separator complying with BS EN 1825-1:2004 and designed in accordance with BS EN 1825-2:2002 or other effective means of grease removal.
Where the site has been previously developed the local authority should be consulted to determine whether any special measures are necessary for control of rodents.
Special measures which may be taken include the following.
Sealed drainage – drainage having access covers to the pipework in the inspection chamber instead of an open channel.
"These should only be used in inspection chambers, where maintenance can be carried out from the surface without personnel entry."
Intercepting traps – These are susceptible to blockage and require frequent maintenance.
Intercepting trap stoppers should be of the locking type that can be easily removed from the chamber surface and securely replaced after blockage clearance.
It is important that stoppers are replaced after maintenance.
These should only be used in inspection chambers where maintenance can be carried out from the surface without personnel entry.
"Rodent barriers – a number of rodent barrier devices are used in other countries; these include: enlarged sections on discharge stacks to prevent rats climbing, flexible downward facing fins in the discharge stack, or one way valves in underground drainage."
Metal cages on ventilator stack terminals should also be used to discourage rats from leaving the drainage system (see paragraph 1.31).
Covers and gratings to gullies may be displaced or attacked by rats.
Solid plastic covers or metal gratings which can be fixed in place should be used to discourage rats from leaving the system.
A drain may run under a building if at least 100mm of granular or other flexible filling is provided round the pipe.
"On sites where excessive subsidence is possible additional flexible joints may be advisable or other solutions such as suspended drainage, particularly where the pipe is adjacent to structures or where soil conditions change in the course of the pipe run."
"Where the crown of the pipe is within 300mm of the underside of the slab, special protection should be provided (see paragraph 2.44)."
"At any points where pipes are built into a structure, including an inspection chamber, manhole, footing, ground beam or wall, suitable measures should be taken to prevent damage or misalignment."
This may be achieved by either:
building in a length of pipe (as short as possible) with its joints as close as possible to the wall faces (within at most 150mm) and connected on each side of rocker pipes by a length of at most 600mm and flexible joints (see Diagram 7(a)); or
forming an opening to give at least 50mm clearance all round the pipe and the opening masked with rigid sheet material to prevent ingress of fill or vermin.
It is important that the void is also filled with a compressible sealant to prevent ingress of gas (see Diagram 7(b)).
A drain trench should not be excavated lower than the foundations of any building nearby (see Diagram 8) unless either:
where the trench is within 1m of the foundation the trench is filled with concrete up to the lowest level of the foundation; or
"where the trench is further than 1m from the building, the trench is filled with concrete to a level below the lowest level for the building equal to the distance from the building, less 150mm."
"Where pipes are to be laid on piles or beams or in a common trench, or where the ground may prove unstable particularly where there is a high water table, advice may be found in TRL A guide to the design loadings for buried rigid pipes."
The local authority may be able to provide information regarding the site.
"The depth of cover will usually depend on the levels of the connections to the system, the gradients at which the pipes should be laid and the ground levels."
Pipes also need to be protected from damage and if the limits of cover are not attainable it may be possible to choose another pipe strength and pipe bedding class combination (Guidance is given in BS EN 1295-1 National Annex NA).
Alternatively special protection can be provided (see paragraphs 2.41 to 2.45).
Drains should have enough capacity to carry the flow.
The flow depends on the appliances connected (see paragraphs 0.1–0.3 and Table 5) and the capacity depends on the size and gradient of the pipes (see Diagram 9).
Sewers (i.e. a drain serving more than one property) should normally have a minimum diameter of 100mm when serving no more than 10 dwellings.
Sewers serving more than 10 dwellings should normally have a minimum diameter of 150mm.
See also Table C1.
"The flow depends on the type, number and grouping of appliances."
Appliances are seldom in use simultaneously and the minimum drain sizes in normal use are capable of carrying the flow from quite large numbers of appliances.
"Table 5 shows approximate flow rates resulting from the typical household group of 1 WC, 1 bath, 1 or 2 washbasins, 1 sink and 1 washing machine used for design purposes in BS EN 12056."
A drain carrying foul water should have an internal diameter of at least 75mm.
A drain carrying effluent from a WC or trade effluent should have an internal diameter of at least 100mm.
Table 6 shows the flattest gradients at which drains should be laid (depending on the flow and the appliances connected to them) and the capacity they will then have (see also paragraphs 0.1–0.3).
Combined systems – the capacity of systems carrying foul water and rainwater should take account of the combined peak flow (see Approved Document H3 Rainwater drainage paragraph 3.8).
"Where gravity drainage is impracticable, or protection against flooding due to surcharge in downstream sewers is required, a pumping installation will be needed."
Package pumping installations are available which are suitable for installation within buildings.
Floor mounted units may be particularly suited for installation in basements.
These should conform to BS EN 12050.
Pumping installations for use inside buildings should be designed in accordance with BS EN 12056-4.
Package pumping installations suitable for installation outside buildings are also available.
Guidance on the design of pumping installations for use outside buildings may be found in BS EN 752-6.
"Where foul water drainage from a building is to be pumped, the effluent receiving chamber should be sized to contain 24-hour inflow to allow for disruption in service."
The minimum daily discharge of foul drainage should be taken as 150 litres per head per day for domestic use.
"For other types of building, the capacity of the receiving chamber should be based on the calculated daily demand of the water intake for the building."
"Where only a proportion of the foul sewage is to be pumped, then the capacity should be based pro-rata."
In all pumped systems the controls should be so arranged to optimise pump operation.
Drainage and waste disposal Approved Document HONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION FOUL DRAINAGE 2.40 Any of the materials shown in Table 7 may be used (the references are to British Standard Specifications).
Joints should be appropriate to the material of the pipes.
To minimise the effects of any differential settlement pipes should have flexible joints.
"All joints should remain watertight under working and test conditions and nothing in the pipes, joints or fittings should project into the pipe line or cause an obstruction."
Different metals should be separated by non-metallic materials to prevent electrolytic corrosion.
The choice of bedding and backfilling depends on the depth at which the pipes are to be laid and the size and strength of the pipes.
Rigid pipes – The types of bedding and backfilling which should be used for rigid pipes of standard strength laid in a trench of any width are shown in Diagram 10 and Tables 8 and 9.
Minimum and maximum depths of cover are also shown for each type.
Flexible pipes – These will become deformed under load and require support to limit the deformation.
The bedding and backfilling should be as shown in Diagram 10.
Minimum and maximum depths of cover are also shown in Table 10.
"flexible filler and at least 75mm of granular material between the top of the pipe and the underside of the flexible filler below the slabs (see Diagram 11 and paragraphs 2.28, 2.42 and 2.43)."
Where it is necessary to backfill the trench with concrete in order to protect nearby foundations (see paragraph 2.25) movement joints formed with compressible board should be provided at each socket or sleeve joint face (see Diagram 12).
100mm 225mm 400mm 600mm Notes:
"All pipes assumed to be Class 120 to BS EN 295; other strengths and sizes of pipe are available, consult manufacturers."
Bedding assumed to be Class B with bedding factor of 1.9; guidance is available on use of higher bedding factors with clayware pipes.
Alternative designs using different pipe strengths and/or bedding types may offer more appropriate or economic options using the procedures set out in BS EN 1295.
Minimum depth in roads set to 1.2m irrespective of pipe strength.
300mm 450mm 600mm Notes:
"All pipes assumed to be Class M to BS 5911; other strengths and sizes of pipe are available, consult manufacturers."
Bedding assumed to be Class B with bedding factor of 1.9.
Alternative designs using different pipe strengths and/or bedding types may offer more appropriate or economic options using the procedures set out in BS EN 1295.
Minimum depth in roads set to 1.2m irrespective of pipe strength.
"For drains and sewers less than 1.5m deep and there is a risk of excavation adjacent to the drain and depth, special calculation is necessary, see BS EN 1295."
"All pipes assumed to be to in accordance with the relevant standard listed in Table 7 with nominal ring stiffness SN4; other strengths and sizes of pipe are available, consult manufacturers."
Bedding assumed to be Class S2 with 80% compaction and average soil conditions.
Alternative designs using different pipe strengths and/or bedding types may offer more appropriate or economic options using the procedures set out in BS EN 1295.
Minimum depth is set to 1.5m irrespective of pipe strength to cover loss of side support from parallel excavations.
Sufficient and suitable access points should be provided for clearing blockages from drain runs which cannot be reached by any other means.
"The siting, spacing and type of the access points will depend on the layout, depth and size of the runs."
The provisions described below are for normal methods of rodding (which need not be in the direction of flow) and not mechanical means of clearing.
Access points should be one of four types.
Tables 11 and 12 show the depth at which each type should be used and the recommended dimensions it should have.
The dimensions should be increased at junctions if they do not allow enough space for branches.
The types are:
rodding eyes – capped extensions of the pipes;
access fittings – small chambers on (or an extension of) the pipes but not with an open channel;
inspection chambers – chambers with working space at ground level;
manholes – deep chambers with working space at drain level.
Siting of access points – access should be provided at the following points:
"on or near the head of each drain run, and"
"at a bend and at a change of gradient, and"
"at a change of pipe size (but see below if it is at a junction), and"
at a junction unless each run can be cleared from an access point (some junctions can only be rodded through from one direction).
Rodding eye As drain but min.
Access fitting small large 150 diam.
The clear opening may be reduced by 20mm in order to provide proper support for the cover and frame.
Drains up to 150mm.
A larger clear opening cover may be used in conjunction with a restricted access.
The size is restricted for health and safety reasons to deter entry.
Larger sizes may be required for manholes on bends or where there are junctions.
"May be reduced to 600 by 600 where required by highway loading considerations, subject to a safe system of work being specified."
Not applicable due to working space needed.
Minimum height of chamber in shafted manhole 2m from benching to underside of reducing slab.
Min. clear space between ladder or steps and the opposite face of the shaft should be approximately 900mm.
"Winch only – no steps or ladders, permanent or removable."
The minimum size of any manhole serving a sewer (i.e. any drain serving more than one property) should be 1200mm x 675mm rectangular or 1200mm diameter.
Access should be provided to long runs.
The distances between access points depend on the types of access used but should not be more than shown in Table 13 for drains up to and including 300mm.
Access points to sewers (serving more than one property) should be in places where they are accessible and apparent for use in an emergency.
"Examples of suitable locations include highways, public open space, unfenced front gardens and shared or unfenced driveways."
Construction of access points – these should contain the foul water under working and test conditions and resist the entry of groundwater and rainwater.
Any of the materials shown in Table 14 may be used.
Where half round channels are used in inspection chambers and manholes the branches up to and including 150mm diameter should discharge into the channel in the direction of flow at or above the level of the horizontal diameter.
A branch with a diameter >150mm should be set with the soffit level with that of the main drain.
Where the angle of the branch is more than 45° a three quarter section branch should be used.
Channels and branches should be benched up at least to the top of the outgoing pipe and at a slope of 1 in 12.
The benching should be rounded at the channel with a radius of at least 25mm.
From Start of external drain 1 Rodding eye Access fitting: small 150 diam.
"Inspection chambers and manholes 2.54 should have removable non-ventilating covers of durable material (such as cast iron, cast or pressed steel, precast concrete or plastics) and be of suitable strength."
Small lightweight access covers should be secured (for example with screws) to deter unauthorised access (for example by children).
Inspection chambers and manholes in buildings should have mechanically fixed airtight covers unless the drain itself has watertight access covers.
Manholes deeper than 1m should have metal step irons or fixed ladders.
Good workmanship is essential.
Workmanship should be in accordance with BS 8000 Workmanship on Building Sites Part 14: Code of practice for below ground drainage.
"During construction, drains and sewers which are left open should be covered when work is not in progress to prevent entry by rats."
Any drain or sewer should be protected from damage by construction traffic and heavy machinery.
Protection may be provided by providing barriers to keep such traffic away from the line of the sewer.
Heavy materials should not be stored over drains or sewers.
Where piling works are being carried out care should be taken to avoid damage to any drain or sewer.
The position of the drain or sewer should be established by survey.
"If the drain or sewer is within 1m of the piling, trial holes should be excavated to establish the exact position of the sewer."
The location of any connections should also be established.
Piling should not be carried out where the distance from the outside of the sewer to the outside of the pile is less than two times the diameter of the pile.
"Water tightness – after laying, including any necessary concrete or other haunching or surrounding and backfilling, gravity drains and private sewers should be tested for water tightness using either an air test or a water test."
Information on test requirements is given in paragraphs 2.60 and 2.61 for pipe sizes up to 300mm.
For further information and for larger sizes see BS 8000 Part 14 or BS EN 1610.
"Air test – for pipes up to 300mm diameter, the pipe should be pressurised up to a pressure of 110mm water gauge and held for approximately 5 minutes prior to testing."
Following this the pipe should be able to hold an initial 100mm pressure with a maximum loss of head on a manometer of 25mm in a period of 7 minutes.
Water test – For pipes up to 300mm diameter the system should be filled with water up to a depth of 5m above the lowest invert in the test section and a minimum depth of 1m measured at the highest invert in the test section.
This may then be left for a period (one hour is generally sufficient) to condition the pipe.
"The test pressure should then be maintained for a period of 30 minutes, by topping up the water level as necessary so that it is within 100mm of the required level throughout the test."
"The losses per square metre of surface area should not exceed 0.15 litres for test lengths with only pipelines or 0.20 litres for test lengths including pipelines and manholes, or 0.40 litres for tests with only manholes and inspection chambers alone (i.e. no pipelines)."
"Connectivity – Where separate drainage systems are provided (see Approved Document H5), connections should be proven to ensure that they are connected to the correct system."
The requirement can also be met by following the relevant recommendations of BS EN 752.
"The relevant clauses are in Part 3, Part 4 and Part 6."
"BS EN 752, together with BS EN 1610 and BS EN 1295, contains additional information about design and construction."
BS EN 12056 describes the discharge unit method of calculating flows.
"Also by providing systems meeting the requirements of BS EN 1091 Vacuum sewerage systems outside buildings, or BS EN 1671 Pressure sewerage systems outside buildings."
"The flow depends on the type, number A.1 and grouping of appliances."
Appliances are seldom in use simultaneously and the minimum stack sizes in normal use are capable of carrying the flow from quite large numbers of appliances.
"Table A1 shows approximate flow rates resulting from the typical household group of 1 WC, 1 bath, 1 or 2 washbasins, 1 sink and 1 washing machine used for design purposes in BS EN 12056."
Flow rates for other commonly used A.3 appliances not covered in Table A1 are shown in Table A2.
Minimum trap sizes and seal depths for appliances not listed in Table A2 are shown in Table A3.
storey building up to 5 storeys.
Alternatively a branch pipe serving any ground floor appliance may discharge direct to a drain or into its own stack.
"If the building has more than 5 storeys A.6 ground floor appliances, unless discharging to a gully or drain, should discharge into their own stack."
"If the building has more than 20 storeys ground floor appliances, unless discharging to a gully or drain, and first floor appliances should discharge into their own stack."
A dry stack may provide ventilation for branch ventilation pipes as an alternative to carrying them to outside air or to a ventilated discharge stack (ventilated system).
Ventilation stacks serving buildings with not more than 10 storeys and containing only dwellings should be at least 32mm diameter (for all other buildings see paragraph 1.29).
The lower end of a stack may be connected A.9 directly to a ventilated discharge stack below the lowest branch discharge pipe connection and above the bend at the foot of the stack or to the crown of the lowest branch discharge pipe connection providing it is ≥75mm diameter.
Sanitary pipework and underground drainage used to collect greywater for recovery and re-use within the building should be designed and constructed in accordance with the guidance in this Approved Document.
All pipework carrying greywater for re-use should be clearly marked with the word ‘GREYWATER’ in accordance with Water Regulations Advisory Scheme Information Guidance Note 09-02-05 Marking and Identification of Pipework for Reclaimed and Grey Water Systems.
Guidance on external storage tanks is given in Approved Document H2.
-02-04 Reclaimed Water Systems.
"Information about installing, modifying or maintaining reclaimed water systems."
"Although the Building Regulations do not include requirements for the continuing maintenance or repair of drains and sewers, local authorities and sewerage undertakers have powers to ensure that adequate maintenance is carried out, that repairs and alterations are carried out properly, and that disused drains and sewers are sealed."
Under Section 48 (Power of local authority to examine and test drains etc. believed to be defective) of the Public Health Act 1936 the local authority may test any drain or sewer where it appears to them that they have reasonable grounds for believing that is in such a condition:
as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance (for example it is harbouring rats); or
(for those drains or sewers indirectly connecting to a public sewer) is so defective that groundwater leaks into it.
"Under Section 114 (Power to investigate defective drain or sewer) of the Water Industry Act 1991, sewerage undertakers may examine and test any drain or private sewer connecting with a public sewer, where it appears to them that they have reasonable grounds for believing that is in such a condition:"
as to be injurious or likely to cause injury to health or be a nuisance; or
is so defective that subsoil water leaks into it.
"Under Section 59 (Drainage of building) of the Building Act 1984 the local authority may require the owner of a building to carry out remedial works where a soil pipe, drain or private sewer is:"
in such a condition as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance; or
so defective that subsoil water leaks into it.
"Under Section 17 (Power to repair drains etc. and to remedy stopped up drains etc.) of the Public Health Act 1961, as amended, local authorities have powers to repair or remove blockages on drains or private sewers which are not sufficiently maintained or kept in good repair or are stopped up, provided the cost does not exceed £250."
They must first give notice to the owner.
The costs may be recovered from the owner or owners of the drain or sewer.
"Although repairs, reconstruction or minor alterations to drains or sewers are not normally covered under the Building Regulations, local authorities have other powers to control such works."
"Material alterations to existing drains and sewers are, however, covered under the Building Regulations."
Notice to be given before repairs or alterations are carried out.
"Under Section 61 (Repair etc. of drain) of the Building Act 1984, any person intending to repair, reconstruct or alter a drain must, except in an emergency, give 24 hours notice to the local authority of their intention to carry out the works."
Where the works are carried out in an emergency they shall not cover over the work without giving such notice.
They must also give free access to the local authority to inspect the works.
"The local authority may, if appropriate, use B.9 their powers under Section 48 of the 1936 Public Health Act (see paragraph B.2) to test the drain, or under Section 59 of the Building Act 1984 (see paragraph B.4) to require remedial works."
Disused drains and sewers offer ideal harbourage to rats and frequently offer a route for them to move between sewers and the surface.
They could also collapse causing subsidence.
"Under Section 62 (Disconnection of drain) of the Building Act 1984, any person who carries out works which result in any part of a drain becoming permanently disused, they shall seal the drain at such points as the local authority may direct."
Section 82 (Notices about demolition) of the Building Act 1984 allows the local authority to require any person demolishing a building to remove or seal any sewer or drain to which the building was connected.
"Under Section 59 (Drainage of building) of the Building Act 1984, the local authority can require the owner of a building to remove, or otherwise render innocuous, any disused drain or sewer which is prejudicial to health or a nuisance."
"Paragraphs B.15 to B.19 give guidance on the appropriate methods associated with the repair and alteration of drains and sewers, and the removal or sealing of disused drains and sewers."
"Repairs, reconstruction and alterations to existing drains and sewers should be carried out to the same standards as new drains and sewers (see Approved Document H1 Section 2)."
"Where new pipework is connected to existing pipework, particular consideration should be given to the following points."
"Ensuring that the existing pipework is not damaged, for example by using proper cutting equipment."
"Ensuring that the resulting joint is water tight, for example by using purpose made repair couplings."
"Ensuring that differential settlement does not occur between the existing and new pipework, for example by proper bedding of the pipework."
Disused drains or sewers provide ideal nesting sites for rats.
In order to prevent this disused drains or sewers should be disconnected from the sewer system as near as possible to the point of connection.
This should be done in a manner which does not damage any pipe which is still in use and ensures that the sewer system is water tight.
"This may be carried out, for example, by removing the pipe from a junction and placing a stopper in the branch of the junction fitting."
Where the connection was to a public sewer the sewerage undertaker should be consulted.
Drains or sewers less than 1.5m deep which are in open ground should as far as is practicable be removed.
"Other pipes should be sealed at both ends and at any point of connection, and grout filled to ensure that rats cannot gain access."
Larger pipes (225mm and above) should be grout filled to prevent subsidence or damage to buildings or services in the event of collapse.
There are a number of different ways in which a sewer may become a public sewer.
Drains serving only one curtilage cannot be adopted by the sewerage undertaker.
"Under Section 104 (Agreements to adopt sewer or sewage disposal works at future date) of the Water Industry Act 1991, a sewerage undertaker may enter into an agreement with a developer to adopt a sewer at some time in the future subject to certain conditions."
In cases of dispute appeals may be made to the Director General of Water Services.
Sewerage undertakers normally require the work to be carried out in accordance with their standards which are published in Sewers for Adoption.
"Under Section 98 (Requisition of public sewer) of the Water Industry Act 1991, the owner or occupier of a building or proposed building or a local authority may requisition a sewer from the sewerage undertaker."
The sewer is constructed by the sewerage undertaker who may use its rights of access to land.
The person requisitioning the sewer may be required to contribute towards the cost of the sewer over a period of 12 years.
"Under Section 102 (Adoption of sewers and disposal works) of the Water Industry Act 1991, a person may request a sewerage undertaker to adopt an existing sewer."
The sewer should be in good condition and accessible.
"In cases of dispute, appeals may be made to the Director General of Water Services."
"Under Section 102 (Adoption of sewers and disposal works) of the Water Industry Act 1991, a sewerage undertaker may decide to adopt an existing sewer of its own volition."
The sewer should be in good condition and accessible.
"In cases of dispute, appeals may be made to the Director General of Water Services."
"Under Section 106 (Right to communicate with public sewer) of the Water Industry Act 1991, the owner or occupier of a building has a right to connect to a public sewer subject to the following restrictions."
"Where the public sewer is designated as either a foul sewer or a surface water sewer, the right is limited to connection of foul drains or surface water drains as appropriate."
The manner of the connection would not be prejudicial to the public sewer system.
days notice is given to the sewerage undertaker of the intention to make the connection.
"Under Section 107 (Right of undertaker to undertake making of communication with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991, the sewerage undertaker may undertake the work of making the connection and recover their reasonable costs."
Alternatively they may allow the developer to undertake to carry out the work under their supervision.
Guidance on making connections to existing sewers is given in paragraphs 2.15 and 2.16.
Section 112 of the Water Industry Act 1991 enables the sewerage undertaker to require that a drain or sewer be constructed in a different manner so that it may form part of the general system of drainage.
The sewerage undertaker repays the person constructing the drain or sewer the additional costs of complying with the undertaker’s requirement.
"Where land or property neighbouring the applicant’s site is likely to be developed, it would be prudent for the applicant to discuss the possibilities with the planning authority and the sewerage undertaker."
"Under Section 37 (Highway created by dedication may become maintainable at public expense) or Section 38 (Power of highway authorities to adopt by agreement) of the Highways Act 1980, a highway authority may adopt, or agree to adopt in the future the drainage associated with a highway."
"Under Section 115 (Use of highway drains as sewers and vice versa) of the Water Industry Act 1991, the highway authority may agree that a highway drain may be used to drain rainwater from buildings."
This power is descretionary.
"The manholes and chambers, especially in private land, should be located so that they are, and continue to be, easily accessible manually or, if necessary, with maintenance equipment such as pipe jetters or mini-excavators."
"H1-2.17, H1-2.25 and Diagram 8."
The distance from foundation to any drain is set out in H1-2.25.
The last access point on the house drain should be sized to allow man entry and should be located in an accessible position.
"This access point should, as far as practicable, be located adjacent to the curtilage and preferably form an interface with the connection to the lateral where it runs outside the curtilage of the property to discharge into a sewer in a highway, into public open space or into third-party land"
"Sewers should not be laid deeper than necessary, but in all cases the structural integrity of the pipe needs to be maintained."
This can normally be done by providing a cover to the top of the pipe barrel of 1.2m or 0.9m in highways or private land respectively.
whether man entry is required.
The first preference should be to provide separate foul and surface water sewerage systems.
"Requirement H5, H1-2.35 and H3-3.5."
"This Approved Document, which took effect on 1 April 2002, deals with the following Requirement which is contained in the Building Regulations 2010."
"Any septic tank and its form of secondary treatment, other wastewater treatment system or cesspool shall be so sited and constructed that:"
it is not prejudicial to the health of any person;
"it will not contaminate any watercourse, underground water or water supply;"
there are adequate means of access for emptying and maintenance; and
"where relevant, it will function to a sufficient standard for the protection of health in the event of a power failure."
"Any septic tank, holding tank which is part of a wastewater treatment system or cesspool shall be:"
of adequate capacity;
so constructed that it is impermeable to liquids; and
"Where a foul water drainage system from a building discharges to a septic tank, wastewater treatment system or cesspool, a durable notice shall be affixed in a suitable place in the building containing information on any continuing maintenance required to avoid risks to health."
In the Secretary of State’s view the requirements of H2 will be met if:
wastewater treatment systems:
have sufficient capacity to enable breakdown and settlement of solid matter in the wastewater from the buildings;
are sited and constructed so as to prevent overloading of the receiving water.
cesspools have sufficient capacity to store the foul water from the building until they are emptied;
wastewater treatment systems and cesspools are sited and constructed so as not to:
be prejudicial to health or a nuisance;
adversely affect water sources or resources;
pollute controlled waters;
be in an area where there is a risk of flooding.
septic tanks and wastewater treatment systems and cesspools are constructed and sited so as to:
have adequate ventilation;
prevent leakage of the contents and ingress of subsoil water.
"having regard to water table levels at any time of the year and rising groundwater levels, drainage fields are sited and constructed so as to:"
avoid overloading of the soakage capacity and
provide adequately for the availability of an aerated layer in the soil at all times.
a notice giving information as to the nature and frequency of maintenance required for the cesspool or wastewater treatment system to continue to function satisfactorily is displayed within each of the buildings.
"A wastewater treatment system may be 0.1 a septic tank, together with a drainage field or other means of secondary treatment, or other wastewater treatment system."
"Paragraphs 1.1 to 1.72 give guidance only 0.2 on the general principles relating to capacity, siting and ventilation of cesspools and wastewater treatment systems."
Any discharge from a wastewater treatment system is likely to require a consent from the Environment Agency.
Note: Initial contact with the Environment Agency is normally made as part of the planning procedures for non-mains drainage.
"Where there have not previously been such discussions with the Environment Agency, those seeking Building Regulations approval for non-mains drainage should contact the area office of the Environment Agency in order to determine whether a consent to discharge is required and what parameters apply."
This should be done before an application is made for Building Regulations approval as it may have a direct bearing on the type of system that may be installed.
Further information is available in the Environment Agency’s Pollution Prevention Guideline No. 4 Disposal of sewage where no mains drainage is available.
Specialist knowledge is advisable in the 0.4 detailed design and installation of small sewage treatment works and guidance is given in BS 6297:1983 Code of practice for design and installation of small sewage treatment works and cesspools (see also paragraph 1.72).
"The use of non-mains foul drainage, such 1.1 as wastewater treatment systems or cesspools, should only be considered where connection to mains drainage is not practicable (see Approved Document H1)."
"Septic tanks provide suitable conditions for 1.2 the settlement, storage and partial decomposition of solids which need to be removed at regular intervals."
"The discharge can, however, still be harmful and will require further treatment from either a drainage field/mound or constructed wetland."
Septic tanks with some form of secondary 1.3 treatment will normally be the most economic means of treating wastewater from small developments (e.g. 1 to 3 dwellings).
"Appropriate forms of secondary treatment for use with septic tanks (drainage fields, drainage mounds or constructed wetlands) are described in paragraphs 1.4 to 1.10 below."
Drainage fields typically consist of a system of sub-surface irrigation pipes which allow the effluent to percolate into the surrounding soil.
Biological treatment takes place naturally in the aerated layers of soil.
Drainage fields may be used to provide secondary treatment in conjunction with septic tanks.
They may be used where the subsoil is sufficiently free-draining and the site is not prone to flooding or waterlogging at any time of year.
The Environment Agency does not permit 1.6 drainage fields or drainage mounds in prescribed Zone 1 groundwater source-protection zones.
Drainage mounds are essentially drainage fields placed above the natural surface of the ground providing an aerated layer of soil to treat the discharge.
"Drainage mounds may be used where the subsoil is occasionally waterlogged, but where drainage fields would otherwise be suitable."
Constructed wetlands (for example reed beds) are man-made systems which exploit the natural treatment capacity of certain wetland plants.
Constructed wetlands discharging to a suitable watercourse may be used to treat septic tank effluent where drainage fields are not practical.
The consent of the Environment Agency may be required.
Packaged treatment works – This term is applied to a range of systems engineered to treat a given hydraulic and organic load using prefabricated components which can be installed with minimal site work.
"They use a number of processes which are different in detail, all treat effluent to a higher standard than septic tank systems and this normally allows direct discharge to a watercourse."
Packaged treatment works discharging to a suitable watercourse will normally be more economic for larger developments than septic tanks.
They should also be considered where space is limited or where other options are not possible.
"Cesspools – A cesspool is a watertight tank, installed underground, for the storage of sewage."
No treatment is involved.
Where no other option is feasible a cesspool may be acceptable.
"Septic tanks should only be used in conjunction with a form of secondary treatment (e.g. a drainage field, drainage mound or constructed wetland)."
Septic tanks should be provided with access for emptying and cleaning.
Access covers should be of durable quality having regard to the corrosive nature of the tank contents.
The access should be lockable or otherwise engineered to prevent personnel entry.
"Septic tanks should be sited at least 7m from any habitable parts of buildings, and preferably downslope."
"Where they are to be emptied using a tanker, the septic tank should be sited within 30m of a vehicle access provided that the invert level of the septic tank is no more than 3m below the level of the vehicle access."
This distance may need to be reduced where the depth to the invert of the tank is more than 3m. There should also be a clear route for the hose such that the tank can be emptied and cleaned without hazard to the building occupants and without the contents being taken through a dwelling or place of work.
"Septic tanks should have a capacity below the level of the inlet of at least 2,700 litres (2.7m³) for up to 4 users."
The size should be increased by 180 litres for each additional user.
"Factory-made septic tanks are available in glass reinforced plastics, polyethylene or steel and should meet the requirements of BS EN 12566-1."
Particular care is necessary in ensuring stability of these tanks.
"Septic tanks may also be constructed in brickwork or concrete, roofed with heavy concrete slabs."
Brickwork should be of engineering bricks and be at least 220mm thick.
The mortar should be a mix of 1:3 cement–sand ratio.
In situ concrete should be at least 150mm thick of C/25/P mix (see BS 5328).
Septic tanks should prevent leakage of the contents and ingress of subsoil water and should be ventilated.
Ventilation should be kept away from buildings.
The inlet and outlet of a septic tank should be designed to prevent disturbance to the surface scum or settled sludge and should incorporate at least two chambers or compartments operating in series.
Where the width of the tank does not exceed 1200mm the inlet should be via a dip pipe.
"To minimise turbulence, provision should be made to limit the flow rate of the incoming foul water."
For steeply laid drains up to 150mm the velocity may be limited by laying the last 12m of the incoming drain at a gradient of 1 in 50 or flatter.
"The inlet and outlet pipes of a septic tank should be provided with access for sampling and inspection (see Approved Document H1, paragraph 2.48)."
A notice should be fixed within the building describing the necessary maintenance.
An example of such wording is:
‘The foul drainage system from this property discharges to a septic tank and a <insert type of secondary treatment>.
The tank requires monthly inspections of the outlet chamber or distribution box to observe that the effluent is free-flowing and clear.
The septic tank requires emptying at least once every 12 months by a licensed contractor.
The <insert type of secondary treatment> should be <insert details of maintenance of secondary treatment>.
Paragraphs 1.27 to 1.44 give guidance on design and construction of drainage fields and drainage mounds to provide secondary treatment to the discharge from a septic tank or package treatment plant.
A drainage field or mound serving a wastewater treatment plant or septic tank should be located:
at least 10m from any watercourse or permeable drain;
at least 50m from the point of abstraction of any groundwater supply and not in any Zone 1 groundwater protection zone;
at least 15m from any building;
"sufficiently far from any other drainage fields, drainage mounds or soakaways so that the overall soakage capacity of the ground is not exceeded."
The disposal area should be downslope of groundwater sources.
No water supply pipes or underground services other than those required by the disposal system itself should be located within the disposal area.
"No access roads, driveways or paved areas should be located within the disposal area."
"Well drained and well aerated subsoils are usually brown, yellow or reddish in colour."
"Examples of subsoils with good percolation characteristics are sand, gravel, chalk, sandy loam and clay loam."
It is important that the percolation characteristics are suitable in both summer and winter conditions.
Poorly drained or saturated subsoils are often grey or blue in colour.
Brown and grey mottling usually indicates periodic saturation.
"Examples of subsoils with poor percolation characteristics are sandy clay, silty clay and clay."
A preliminary assessment should be carried out including consultation with the Environment Agency and local authority to determine the suitability of the site.
The natural vegetation on the site should also give an indication of its suitability for a drainage field.
A trial hole should be dug to determine the position of the standing groundwater table.
"The trial hole should be a minimum of 1m2 in area and 2m deep, or a minimum of 1.5m below the invert of the proposed drainage field pipework."
The groundwater table should not rise to within 1m of the invert level of the proposed effluent distribution pipes.
"If the test is carried out in summer, the likely winter groundwater levels should be considered."
A percolation test should then be carried out to assess the further suitability of the proposed area.
Percolation test method – A hole 300mm square should be excavated to a depth 300mm below the proposed invert level of the effluent distribution pipe.
"Where deep drains are necessary the hole should conform to this shape at the bottom, but may be enlarged above the 300mm level to enable safe excavation to be carried out."
Where deep excavations are necessary a modified test procedure may be adopted using a 300mm earth auger.
Bore the test hole vertically to the appropriate depth taking care to remove all loose debris.
Fill the 300mm square section of the hole to a depth of at least 300mm with water and allow it to seep away overnight.
"Next day, refill the test section with water to a depth of at least 300mm and observe the time, in seconds, for the water to seep away from 75% full to 25% full level (i.e. a depth of 150mm)."
Divide this time by 150.
The answer gives the average time in seconds (Vp) required for the water to drop 1mm.
The test should be carried out at least three times with at least two trial holes.
The average figure from the tests should be taken.
"The test should not be carried out during abnormal weather conditions such as heavy rain, severe frost or drought."
Drainage field disposal should only be used when percolation tests indicate average values of Vp of between 12 and 100 and the preliminary site assessment report and trial hole tests have been favourable.
This minimum value ensures that untreated effluent cannot percolate too rapidly into groundwater.
Where Vp is outside these limits effective treatment is unlikely to take place in a drainage field.
"However, provided that an alternative form of secondary treatment is provided to treat the effluent from the septic tanks, it may still be possible to discharge the treated effluent to a soakaway."
Drainage fields or mounds (see Diagrams 1 and 2) should be designed and constructed to ensure aerobic contact between the liquid effluent and the subsoil.
"Drainage fields should be constructed using perforated pipe, laid in trenches of a uniform gradient which should be not steeper than 1:200."
Pipes should be laid on a 300mm layer of clean shingle or broken stone graded between 20mm and 50mm.
"To provide venting of the filter, the upstream ends of the distribution pipes may be extended vertically above mound level and capped with a cowl or grille."
Surface water runoff and uncontaminated seepage from the surrounding soil may be cut off by shallow interceptor drains and diverted away from the mound.
There must be no seepage of wastewater to such an interceptor drain.
"Where the permeable soil is slow draining and overlaid on an impervious layer, the mound filter system should be constructed on a gently sloping site."
Trenches should be filled to a level 50mm above the pipe and covered with a layer of geotextile to prevent the entry of silt.
The remainder of the trench can be filled with soil; the distribution pipes should be laid at a minimum depth of 500mm below the surface.
"Drainage trenches should be from 300mm to 900mm wide, with areas of undisturbed ground 2m wide being maintained between parallel trenches (see Diagram 1)."
An inspection chamber should be installed between the septic tank and the drainage field.
Drainage fields should be set out as a continuous loop fed from the inspection chamber (see Diagram 1).
"To calculate the floor area of the drainage field (At in m²), the following formula should be used:"
"where p is the number of persons served by the tank, Vp is the percolation value (secs/mm) obtained as described in paragraphs 1.34–1.38."
Reed bed treatment systems or other constructed wetland treatment systems can be used to provide secondary or tertiary treatment of effluent from septic tanks or packaged treatment works.
"The systems purify wastewater as it moves through the gravel bed around the rhizomes and roots, by removing organic matter (BOD), oxidising ammonia, reducing nitrate and removing a little phosphorus."
"The mechanisms are complex and involve bacterial oxidation, filtration, sedimentation and chemical precipitation."
"Reed beds generally use the common reed (Phragmites australis); other types of plants used in constructed wetlands include the reed maces (Typha latifolia), the rush (Juncus effusus), the true bulrush (Schoenoplectus lacustris) as well as members of the sedge family (Carex) and the yellow flag (Iris pseudacorus)."
Constructed wetlands should not be constructed in the shade of trees or buildings as this will result in poor or patchy growth.
"Although winter performance is generally similar with respect to removal of BOD and suspended solids, it tends to be poorer than in summer for removal of ammonia due to lower temperatures."
This should be taken into consideration during the design stage.
"There are two main designs of constructed wetland system, horizontal flow and vertical flow."
Horizontal flow systems are continuously fed with wastewater from one end.
The effluent flows horizontally through the gravel bed over the full width of the bed to the outlet end (see Diagram 3).
"Horizontal flow systems tend to be oxygen limited and they therefore tend not to be able to completely treat concentrated effluents, particularly those with high levels of ammonia."
Horizontal flow systems require a level site.
As they only use a single bed less maintenance is required than with vertical flow systems.
Vertical flow systems are intermittently fed with wastewater from the top flooding the surface followed by a period of rest.
For this reason two or more beds are normally provided so that they can be used in rotation.
The flow is predominantly downward to an outlet at the bottom (see Diagram 4) and is collected by a drainage network at the base.
"They therefore require a fall of between 1m and 2m. Vertical flow systems can achieve much better oxygen transfer than horizontal flow systems and therefore achieve more complete treatment, particularly of ammonia."
They generally require more maintenance than horizontal systems.

Maintenance is required <insert frequency> and should be carried out by the owner in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
The site of the cesspool should preferably be on ground sloping away from and sited lower than any existing building in the immediate vicinity.
Cesspools should be sited at least 7m from any habitable parts of buildings and preferably downslope.
Cesspools should be sited within 30m of a vehicle access and at such levels that they can be emptied and cleaned without hazard to the building occupants or the contents being taken through a dwelling or place of work.
Access may be through a covered space which may be lockable.
"Cesspools should have a capacity below the level of the inlet of at least 18,000 litres (18m³) for 2 users."
This size should be increased by 6800 litres (6.8m³) for each additional user.
"Cesspools should have no openings except for the inlet, access for emptying and ventilation."

The system should be emptied approximately every <insert design emptying frequency> by a licensed contractor and inspected fortnightly for overflow.
Paragraphs 1.70 to 1.71 give guidance on tanks for the storage of greywater or rainwater for re-use within the building.
It does not apply to water butts used for the storage of rainwater for garden use.
Greywater and rainwater tanks should:
"prevent leakage of the contents and ingress of subsoil water, and should be ventilated;"
have an anti-backflow device on any overflow connected to a drain or sewer to prevent contamination of the stored greywater or rainwater in the event of surcharge in the drain or sewer;

"Under Section 48 (Power of local authority to examine and test drains etc. believed to be defective) of the Public Health Act 1936, the local authority may test any cesspool, septic tank or settlement tank where it appears to them that they have reasonable grounds for believing that it is in such a condition as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance."
"Power in respect of overflowing or leaking cesspools, septic tanks, etc."
"Under Section 50 (Overflowing and leaking cesspools) of the Public Health Act 1936, the local authority can take action against any person who has caused by their action, default or sufferance, a septic tank, settlement tank or cesspool to leak or overflow."
They may require the person to carry out repairs or to periodically empty the tank.
"This does not apply to the overflow of A.4 treated effluent or flow from a septic tank into a drainage field, provided the overflow is not prejudicial to health or a nuisance."
"It should be noted that under this section A.5 action could be taken against a builder who had caused the problem, and not just against the owner."
"Under Section 59 (Drainage of building) of the Building Act 1984, the local authority may require the owner or occupier of a building to carry out remedial works where a septic tank, settlement tank or cesspool is:"
in such a condition as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance; or
so defective that groundwater leaks into it.
"Disused septic tanks, cesspools, etc."
"Also under Section 59 (Drainage of building) of the Building Act 1984, where a disused cesspool, septic tank or settlement tank is prejudicial to health or a nuisance, the local authority may require either the owner or the occupier to fill or remove the tank or otherwise render it innocuous."
"The Environment Agency has powers A.8 under Section 85 (Offences of polluting controlled waters) of the Water Resources Act 1991 to prosecute anyone causing or knowingly permitting pollution of any stream, river, lake, etc. or any groundwater."

They can require such a person to carry out works to prevent the pollution.
Paragraphs A.11 to A.22 give guidance on the appropriate maintenance of wastewater treatment systems and cesspools.
Septic tanks should be inspected monthly to check they are working correctly.
The effluent in the outlet from the tank should be free-flowing and clear.
The flow in the inlet chamber should also be free-flowing.
"If the flow is incorrect, the tank should A.12 be emptied by a licensed contractor."
Some contractors offer annual maintenance contracts at reduced rates.
The septic tank should be emptied at least once a year.
It is recommended that not all sludge is removed as it can act as an anaerobic seed.
"mound, the sediments can block the pores in the soil, necessitating the early replacement of the drainage field/mound."
"Occasionally, it can render the site unsuitable for future use as drainage field/mound."
The drainage field/mound should be checked on a monthly basis to ensure that it is not waterlogged and that the effluent is not backing up towards the septic tank.
The outlet of the works should be inspected regularly.
flowing and clear.
Maintenance will vary depending on the type of plant; regular maintenance and inspection should be carried out in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
"Where the treatment works serve more than one property, the developer may seek to get it adopted by the sewerage undertaker under Section 102 (Adoption of sewers and disposal works) or Section 104 (Agreements to adopt a sewer or disposal works at a future date) of the Water Industry Act 1991 (see Approved Document H1, Appendix H1-B)."
Guidance on maintenance of reed beds can be found in BRE Good Building Guide No. 42.
Cesspools should be inspected fortnightly for overflow and emptied as required.
Typically they require emptying on a monthly basis by a licensed contractor.
Emptying frequencies may be estimated by assuming a filling rate of 150 litres per person per day.
"If the cesspool does not fill within the estimated period, the tank should be checked for leakage."
"This Approved Document, which took effect on 1 April 2002, deals with the following Requirement which is contained in the Building Regulations 2010."
Adequate provision shall be made for rainwater to be carried from the roof of the building.
Paved areas around the building shall be so constructed Requirement H3(2) applies only to paved areas:
as to be adequately drained.
"paragraphs (1) or (2) shall discharge to one of the following, listed in order of priority:"
"an adequate soakaway or some other adequate infiltration system; or, where that is not reasonably practicable,"
"a watercourse; or, where that is not reasonably practicable,"
In the Secretary of State’s view the requirements of H3 will be met if:
rainwater from roofs and paved areas is carried away from the surface either by a drainage system or by other means;
a rainwater drainage system:
"carries the flow of rainwater from the roof to an outfall (a soakaway, a watercourse, a surface water or a combined sewer),"
"which provide access to the building pursuant to requirement M1 (access and use of buildings other than dwellings), or requirement M2 (access to extensions to buildings other than dwellings), or requirement M4(1), (2) or (3) (access to and use of dwellings);"
which provide access to or from a place of storage pursuant to requirement H6(2) (solid waste storage); or
"in any passage giving access to the building, where this is intended to be used in common by the occupiers of one or more other buildings."
Requirement H3(3) does not apply to the gathering of rainwater for re-use.
"minimises the risk of blockage or leakage,"
is accessible for clearing blockages.
rainwater soaking into the ground is distributed sufficiently so that it does not damage the foundations of the proposed building or any adjacent structure.
to the drainage of paved areas apply only to paved areas:
"provided in accordance with requirements M2 and M4, to provide access to the principal entrance (see Approved Document M volume 2 section 1 for buildings other than dwellings and Approved Document M volume 1 sections 1A, 2A and 3A for dwellings);"
"provided in accordance with requirement H6 to give access from the building to the place for storing refuse, and from the place of storage to the collection point (see Approved Document H6);"
which are yards or other forms of access intended to be used in common by more than one building.
The provisions of H3 only apply if these surfaces are paved.
Methods of drainage other than connection to a public surface water sewer are encouraged where they are technically feasible.
The capacity of the drainage system 0.3 should be large enough to carry the expected flow at any point in the system.
The flow depends on the area to be 0.4 drained and the intensity of the rainfall.
The capacity depends on the size and 0.5 gradient of the gutters and pipes.
Capacities and minimum sizes are given in the text.
Rainwater or surface water should not be discharged to a cesspool or septic tank.
should be obtained from Diagram 1.
"For eaves, gutters the rainfall intensity 1.2 Where the design incorporates valley gutters, parapet gutters, siphonic or drainage systems from flat roofs, and where over-topping of these systems would have particularly high consequences such as water entering the building, wetting of insulation or other dampness the design should be carried out in accordance with BS EN 12056 (see paragraph 1.17)."
"The flow into a gutter depends on the area 1.3 of surface being drained and whether the surface is flat or pitched (and, if it is pitched, on the angle of pitch)."
Table 1 shows a way of allowing for the pitch by working out an effective area.
Table 2 shows the largest effective area 1.4 which should be drained into the gutter sizes which are most often used.
"These sizes are for a gutter which is laid level, half round in section with a sharp edged outlet at only one end and where the distance from a stop end to the outlet is not more than 50 times the water depth."
At greater distances the capacity of the gutter should be reduced.
The Table shows the smallest size of outlet which should be used with the gutter.
"Where the outlet is not at the end, the gutter should be of the size appropriate to the larger of the areas draining into it."
Where there are two end outlets they may be up to 100 times the depth of flow apart.
Note: Refers to nominal half round eaves gutters laid level with outlets at one end sharp edged.
Round edged outlets allow smaller downpipe sizes.
Gutters should be laid with any fall towards the nearest outlet.
Where there is a fall or the gutter has a section which gives it larger capacity than a half-round gutter or the outlet is round edged it may be possible to reduce the size of the gutter and pipe.
Paragraph 1.17 gives a reference to some detailed recommendations which make reductions possible.
"Gutters should also be laid so that any overflow in excess of the design capacity, caused by conditions such as above normal rainfall, will be discharged clear of the building, reducing the risk of overspilling of rainwater into the building or structural overload."
"On flat roofs, valley gutter, and parapet gutters, additional outlets may be necessary."
Rainwater pipes should discharge into a drain or gully but may discharge to another gutter or onto another surface if it is drained.
Any rainwater pipe which discharges into a combined system should do so through a trap (see Approved Document H1).
"Where a rainwater pipe discharges onto a lower roof or paved area, a pipe shoe should be fitted to divert water away from the building."
"Where rainwater from a roof with an effective area greater than 25m² discharges through a single downpipe onto a lower roof, a distributor pipe should be fitted to the shoe to ensure that the flow width at the receiving gutter is sufficient so that it does not over-top the gutter."
The size of a rainwater pipe should be at least the size of the outlet from the gutter.
A down pipe which serves more than one gutter should have an area at least as large as the largest of the contributing outlets and should be of sufficient size to take the flow from the whole contributing area.
Siphonic roof drainage systems should be designed in accordance with BS EN 12056-3 (see paragraph 1.17) and should take particular account of the following:
The need to take account of surcharge in the downstream drainage system as this can reduce the flow in the downpipe.
For long gutters the time taken for the system to prime the siphonic action may be excessive.
Overflow arrangements should be provided to prevent gutters from over-topping.
Further information on the design of siphonic drainage systems can be found in Hydraulics Research Ltd Report SR 463 Performance of Syphonic Drainage Systems for Roof Gutters.
Eaves drop systems allow rainwater from roofs to drop freely to the ground.
"Where these are used, they should be designed taking into account the following:"
storage tanks should comply with requirement H2 (see Approved Document H2 paragraphs 1.69 to 1.71);
"pipework, washouts and valves should be clearly identified on marker plates (see Water Regulations Advisory Scheme Information Guidance Note 09-02-05 Marking and Identification of Pipework for Reclaimed and Grey Water Systems)."
Reclaimed Water Systems.
"Information about installing, modifying or maintaining reclaimed water systems."
"The materials used should be of adequate strength and durability, and"
all gutter joints should remain water tight under working conditions.
"Pipes inside a building should be capable of withstanding the air tightness test described in paragraph 1.32 of Approved Document H1, and"
"pipework in siphonic roof drainage systems should be able to resist to negative pressures in accordance with the design, and"
"gutters and rainwater pipes should be firmly supported without restricting thermal movement, and"
"the protection of the fabric of the building from ingress of water, caused by water splashing on the external walls;"
different metals should be separated by non-metallic material to prevent electrolytic corrosion.
The performance can also be met by following the relevant recommendations of BS EN 12056 Gravity drainage systems inside buildings.
"The relevant clauses are in Part 3 Roof drainage layout and calculation, Clauses 3 to 7, annex A and National Annexes, and in Part 5 Installation, testing instructions for operation maintenance and use, Clauses 3, 4, 6 and 11."
These standards contain additional detailed information about design and construction.
the need to prevent water from entering doorways and windows;
"the need to protect persons using doorways, etc. from falling water;"
"the need to protect persons and the fabric of the building from rainwater as it hits the ground by splashing, for example by provision of a gravel layer or angled concrete apron deflecting the water away from the building;"
the protection of foundations from concentrated discharges such as those from valleys or valley gutters or from excessive flows due to large roofs (i.e. where the area of roof per unit length of eaves is high).
Rainwater drainage systems used to collect water for re-use within the building (rainwater recovery systems) should take account of the following:
This section gives guidance on the design 2.1 of paved areas for rainwater drainage systems.
"It is applicable to the drainage of paved areas around buildings and small car parks up to 4,000m²."
"For the design of systems serving larger catchments, reference should be made to BS EN 752-4 (see paragraph 2.19)."
Surface gradients should direct water 2.2 draining from a paved area away from buildings.
"Where the levels would otherwise cause water to concentrate along the wall of a building, a reverse gradient should be created, for at least 500mm from the wall of the building, to divert the water away from the wall."
Approved Document H Drainage and waste disposalONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 2.11 Pervious paving should not be used where excessive amounts of sediment are likely to enter the pavement and block the pores.
"Pervious paving should not be used in oil storage areas, or where runoff may be contaminated with pollutants."
Surface water should not be allowed to soak into the ground where ground conditions are not suitable (see paragraph 3.25).
Further information on pervious paving can be obtained from CIRIA report C522 – Sustainable urban drainage systems – design manual for England and Wales.
"Where it is not possible for surfaces to be freedraining, or to use pervious paving, impervious paving should be used with gullies or channels discharging to a drainage system."
Gullies should be provided at low points where water would otherwise pond.
Intermediate gullies should be provided at intervals to ensure that gullies are not overloaded and the depth of flow in channels is not excessive.
Gully gratings should be set approximately 5mm below the level of the surrounding paved area in order to allow for settlement.
"Provision should be made to prevent silt and grit entering the system, either by provision of gully pots of suitable size or by catchpits."
Drainage from large paved areas should be designed in accordance with BS EN 752-4 (see 2.19).
"The performance can also be met by following the relevant recommendations of BS EN 752-4:1998 Drain and sewer systems outside buildings, Part 4 Hydraulic design and environmental aspects."
The relevant clauses are Clause 11 and National Annexes ND and NE.
Gradients on impervious surfaces should be designed to permit the water to drain quickly from the surface.
A gradient of at least 1 in 60 is recommended.
The gradient across a path should not exceed 1 in 40.
second/m² may be assumed for normal situations.
Where ponding of rainfall is undesirable rainfall intensities should be obtained from Diagram 2.
"For very high risk areas, where ponding 2.5 would lead to flooding of buildings, the drainage should be designed in accordance with BS EN 752-4 (see paragraph 2.19)."
"of paving should be freedraining to a pervious area such as grassland, provided that:"
"Paths, driveways and other narrow areas a. the water is not discharged adjacent to buildings where it could damage foundations; and"
the soakage capacity of the ground is not overloaded.
Where water is to be drained onto the adjacent ground the edge of the paving should be finished above or flush with the surrounding ground to allow the water to runoff.
"Where the surrounding ground is not sufficiently permeable to accept the flow, filter drains may be provided (see paragraph 3.33)."
"permeable surface overlying a granular layer which acts as a storage reservoir, retaining peak flows while the water soaks into the underlying subsoil."
They should be considered for larger paved areas where it is not possible to drain the rainwater to an adjacent pervious area.
The design of the storage layer is undertaken on a similar basis to the design of the storage volume in soakaways (see paragraphs 3.24–3.28).
"Where infiltration is not possible (see paragraph 3.25), they may also be used with an impermeable barrier below the storage layer as a detention tank prior to flows discharging to a drainage system (see paragraph 3.35)."
"For steeply sloping surfaces, a check should be made to ensure that the water level can rise sufficiently in the granular storage layer to allow the storage capacity to be mobilised."
A check should also be made to ensure that the stored water will not accumulate around the foundations of the building.
"Where infiltration is not possible (see paragraph 3.25), they may also be used with an impermeable barrier below the storage layer as a detention tank prior to flows discharging to a drainage system (see paragraph 3.35)."
This section gives guidance on the 3.1 design of surface water drainage systems.
It is applicable to the drainage of small catchments with impervious areas up to 2 hectares.
"For the design of systems serving larger catchments, reference should be made to BS EN 752-4 (see paragraph 3.36)."
to a soakaway or other infiltration system where practicable.
"Surface water drainage should discharge 3.3 Discharge to a watercourse may require a consent from the Environment Agency, who may limit the rate of discharge."
Maximum flow rates can be limited by provision of detention basins (see paragraph 3.35).
"Where other forms of outlet are not practicable, discharge should be made to a sewer."
Some sewers carry both foul water and 3.5 surface water (combined systems) in the same pipe.
Where they do the sewerage undertaker can allow surface water to discharge into the system if the sewer has enough capacity to take the added flow (see Approved Document H1 paragraph 2.1).
Some private sewers (drains serving more than one building that have not been adopted by the sewerage undertaker) also carry both foul water and surface water.
"If a sewer operated as a combined system does not have enough capacity, the surface water should be run in a separate system with its own outfall."
"In some circumstances, where a sewer is 3.6 operated as a combined system and has sufficient capacity, separate drainage should still be provided (see Approved Document H5)."
Surface water drainage connected to 3.7 combined sewers should have traps on all inlets.
second/m² may be assumed for normal situations.
Alternatively the rainfall intensity may be obtained from Diagram 2.
Where low levels of surface flooding could cause flooding of buildings the rainfall intensities should be obtained from BS EN 752-4 (see paragraph 3.36).
"Where there is evidence of a liability to surcharging from sewers, or levels in the building or on the site make gravity connection impracticable, surface water lifting equipment will be needed (see Approved Document H1 paragraphs 2.8 to 2.12)."
Refer to paragraphs 2.13 to 2.21 of Approved Document H1.
Refer to paragraphs 2.27 and 2.28 of Approved Document H1.
Drains should have enough capacity to carry the flow.
The capacity depends on the size and gradients of the pipes.
Drains should be at least 75mm diameter.
Surface water sewers (serving more than one building) should have a minimum size of 100mm.
Diagram 3 shows the capacities of drains of various sizes at different gradients.
"However the capacity can be increased by increasing the gradient, or by using larger pipes."
75mm and 100mm rainwater drains should be laid at not less than 1:100.
150mm drains and sewers should be laid at gradients not less than 1:150 and 225mm drains should be laid at gradients not less than 1:225.
For minimum gradients for larger pipes see BS EN 752-4 (see paragraph 3.36).
See paragraph 2.40 of Approved Document H1.
See paragraphs 2.41 to 2.45 of Approved Document H1.
See paragraphs 2.46 to 2.54 of Approved Document H1.
See paragraphs 2.55 to 2.58 of Approved Document H1.
See paragraphs 2.59 to 2.62 of Approved Document H1.
"Where any materials which could cause pollution are stored or used, separate drainage systems should be provided."
This should include an appropriate form of separator or treatment system or the flow should be discharged into a system suitable for receiving polluted effluent.
"On car parks, petrol filling stations or other areas where there is likely to be leakage or spillage of oil, drainage systems should be provided with oil interceptors (see Appendix H3-A)."
"swales, infiltration basins and filter drains."
"Infiltration devices include soakaways, 3.24 Further information on the design of infiltration drainage systems can be found in CIRIA Report 156 – Infiltration drainage – Manual of good practice."
Infiltration drainage is not always possible.
Infiltration devices should not be built:
within 5m of a building or road or in areas of unstable land (see Planning Policy Guidance Note 14 Annex 1);
in ground where the water table reaches the bottom of the device at any time of the year;
"sufficiently far from any drainage fields, drainage mounds or other soakaways so that the overall soakage capacity of the ground is not exceeded and the effectiveness of any drainage field is not impaired (see Approved Document H2);"
where the presence of any contamination in the runoff could result in pollution of a groundwater source or resource.
"Soakaways for areas less than 100m² are generally formed from square or circular pits, filled with rubble or lined with dry-jointed masonry or perforated ring units."
Soakaways serving larger areas are generally lined pits or trench type soakaways.
Soakaways should be designed to a return period of once in ten years.
The design should be carried out with storms of differing durations to determine the duration which gives the largest storage volume.
For small soakaways serving 25m² or less a design rainfall of 10mm in 5 minutes may be assumed to give the worst case.
For soakaways serving larger areas reference should be made to the sources listed in paragraph 3.30.
Where the ground is marginal overflow drains can be acceptable.
Percolation tests should be carried out to determine the capacity of the soil (see Approved Document H2 paragraphs 1.34 to 1.38).
"Where the test is carried out in accordance with Approved Document H2, the soil infiltration rate (f) is related to the value Vp derived from the test by the equation:"
"The storage volume should be calculated so that, over the duration the storm, it is sufficient to contain the difference between the inflow volume and the outflow volume."
The inflow volume is calculated from the rainfall depth (see paragraph 3.26) and the area drained.
The outflow volume (O) is calculated from the equation:
"Where as50 is the area of the side of the storage volume when filled to 50% of its effective depth, and D is the duration of the storm in minutes."
"Soakaways serving larger areas should be designed in accordance with BS EN 752-4 (see paragraph 3.36), or BRE Digest 365 Soakaway design."
Swales are grass-lined channels which transport rainwater from a site as well as controlling flow and quality of surface runoff.
Some of the flow infiltrates into the ground.
There may be an overflow at the end into another form of infiltration device or a watercourse.
"They are particularly suitable for treatment of runoff from small residential developments, parking areas and roads."
Infiltration basins are dry grass-lined 3.32 basins designed to promote infiltration of surface water to the ground.
"Drainage and waste disposal Approved Document HONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE 3.33 Filter drains or french drains consist of the trench, lined with a geotextile membrane and filled with gravel."
Much of the flow infiltrates into the ground.
A perforated pipe is often laid through the gravel to assist drainage.
"Flow enters the top of the filter drain directly from runoff, or is discharged into it through drains."
"Detention ponds are used to attenuate the flow from a drainage system, to limit the peak rate of flow into a sewer system or watercourse."
Further information on design may be found in the references given in paragraph 3.36 and in Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems – A Design Manual for England and Wales published by CIRIA.
The requirement can also be met by following the relevant recommendations of BS EN 752-4 Drain and sewer systems outside buildings.
"The relevant clauses are in Part 4 Hydraulic design and environmental considerations Clauses 3 to 12 and National Annexes NA, NB and ND to NI."
"BS EN 752, together with BS EN 1295 and BS EN 1610, contains additional detailed information about design and construction."
"Under Section 85 (Offences of polluting controlled waters) of the Water Resources Act 1991, it is an offence to discharge any noxious or polluting material into a watercourse, coastal water or underground water."
Most surface water sewers discharge to watercourses.
"Under Section 111 (Restrictions on use of public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991, it is an offence to discharge petrol into any drain or sewer connected to a public sewer."
Premises keeping petrol must be licensed under the Petroleum (Consolidation) Act 1928.
Conditions may be placed on licences.
The Environment Agency issues guidance A.4 notes on the provision of oil separators.
The Health and Safety Executive issues A.5 guidance notes on the storage of oil.
"For most paved areas around buildings or A.6 car parks where a separator is required, a by-pass separator should be provided which has a nominal size (NSB) equal to 0.0018 times the contributing area."
In addition it should have a silt storage volume in litres equal to 100 times NSB.
In fuel storage areas and other high risk A.7 areas full retention separators are required.
These should have a nominal size (NS) equal to 0.018 times the contributing area.
In addition it should have a silt storage volume in litres equal to 100 times NS.
Separators discharging to infiltration devices or surface water sewers should be Class I.
Separators should be leak tight.
Inlet arrangements should not be direct to the water surface.
Adequate ventilation should be provided.
Separators should comply with the requirements of the Environment Agency and with BS EN 858-2002 A1 2004 and BS EN 858-2:2003.
"In addition, where the Petroleum Act applies, they should comply with the requirements of the licensing authority."
Separators should be maintained regularly to ensure their continued effectiveness.
Provision should be made for access for inspection and maintenance.
This can be obtained from the Environment Agency.
"This Approved Document, which took effect on 1 April 2002, deals with the following Requirement which is contained in the Building Regulations 2010."
"The erection or extension of a building or work involving the underpinning of a building shall be carried out in a way that is not detrimental to the building or building extension or to the continued maintenance of the drain, sewer or disposal main."
"In this paragraph ‘disposal main’ means any pipe, tunnel or conduit used for the conveyance of effluent to or from a sewage disposal works, which is not a public sewer."
In this paragraph and paragraph H5 ‘map of sewers’ means any records kept by a sewerage undertaker under section 199 of the Water Industry Act 1991 (a).
56; Section 199 was amended by Section 97 of the Water Act 2003 (c. 37).
In the Secretary of State’s view the requirements of H4 will be met if:
the building or extension or work involving underpinning:
"is constructed or carried out in a manner which will not overload or otherwise cause damage to the drain, sewer or disposal main either during or after the construction;"
"will not obstruct reasonable access to any manhole or inspection chamber on the drain, sewer or disposal main;"
"in the event of the drain, sewer or disposal main requiring replacement, there is a satisfactory diversionary route or the building or the extension will not unduly obstruct work to replace the drain, sewer or disposal main, on its present alignment;"
Requirement H4 applies only to work carried out:
"over a drain, sewer or disposal main which is shown on any map of sewers; or"
"on any site or in such a manner as may result in interference with the use of, or obstruction of the access of any person to, any drain, sewer or disposal main which is shown on any map of sewers."
"the risk of damage to the building as a result of failure of the drain, sewer or disposal main is not excessive having regard to:"
the nature of the ground;
"the condition, location or construction of the drain, sewer or disposal main;"
"the nature, volume and pressure of the flow in the drain, sewer or disposal main;"
the design and construction of the foundations of the building.
"extension or underpinning of a building over or within 3m of the centreline of an existing drain, sewer or disposal main shown on the sewerage undertaker’s sewer records whether that sewer is a public sewer or not."
Copies of the sewer record maps are held by the sewerage undertaker and by local authorities.
These are available for inspection during office hours.
"Where it is proposed to construct a building over or near a drain or sewer shown on any map of sewers, the developer should consult the owner of the drain or sewer, if the owner is not the developer himself."
"In the case of a public sewer the owner is the sewerage undertaker, who may be able to advise on the condition of the sewer or arrange an inspection."
A satisfactory diversionary route should 1.4 be available so that the drain or sewer could be reconstructed without affecting the building.
This route should not pass within 3m from the building.
Where the drain or sewer is more than 1.5m deep and the drain or sewer is accessible to mechanical excavators the alternative route should also have such access.
If repair or replacement of a public 0.4 sewer is required it will be carried out by the sewerage undertaker.
"Where it is proposed to construct a building or extension over a sewer which is intended for adoption, it is advisable to consult the sewerage undertaker."
Some soils are easily eroded by 1.1 groundwater leaking into the drain or sewer.
"Examples of such soils include fine sands, fine silty sands, saturated silts and peat."
Buildings should not be constructed over or within 3m of drains or sewers in such soils unless special measures are taken in the design and construction of foundations to prevent undue risk to the building in the event of failure of the drain or sewer.
Special measures will not be needed if the invert of the drain or sewer is:
above the level of the foundations; and
above the groundwater level; and
no more than 1m deep.
A building constructed over or within 3m of:
any rising main (except those used solely to drain the building);
any drain or sewer constructed from brick or masonry;
would be exposed to a high level of risk in the event of failure of the drain or sewer.
Buildings should not be constructed in such a position unless special measures are taken.
Buildings or extensions should not be constructed over a manhole or inspection chamber or other access fitting on any sewer (serving more than one property).
"Approved Document H1 Section 2, paragraph 2.53 provides that access points to sewers (serving more than one property) should be in places where they are accessible and apparent for use in an emergency."
"Buildings and extensions should not be located where they would remove such a provision where this already exists, unless an alternative access point can be provided on the line of the sewer at a location acceptable to the owner (i.e. the sewerage undertaker in the case of a public sewer)."
The length of drain or sewer under a 1.5 building should not exceed 6m except with the permission of the owners of the drain or sewer (i.e. the sewerage undertaker in case of a public sewer).
"Buildings or extensions should not be constructed over or within 3m of any drain or sewer more than 3m deep, or greater than 225mm in diameter except with the permission of the owners of the drain or sewer (i.e. the sewerage undertaker in the case of a public sewer)."
Any drain or sewer should be protected 1.7 from damage by construction traffic and heavy machinery.
Protection may be provided by providing barriers to keep such traffic away from the line of the sewer.
Heavy materials should not be stored over drains or sewers.
Where piling works are being carried out care should be taken to avoid damage to any drain or sewer.
The position of the drain or sewer should be established by survey.
"If the drain or sewer is within 1m of the piling, trial holes should be excavated to establish the exact position of the sewer."
The location of any connections should also be established.
Piling should not be carried out where the distance from the outside of the sewer to the outside of the pile is less than twice the diameter of the pile.
Where a drain or sewer runs under a building at least 100mm of granular or other suitable flexible filling should be provided round the pipe.
On sites where excessive subsidence is possible additional flexible joints may be advisable or other solutions adopted such as suspended drainage.
"Where the crown of the pipe is within 300mm of the underside of the slab, special protection should be provided (see Approved Document H1, Section 2, paragraph 2.44)."
"Where a drain or sewer running below a building is less than 2m deep, the foundation should be extended locally so that the drain or sewer passes through the wall (see paragraph 1.11)."
Where a drain or sewer runs through a wall or foundation suitable measures should be taken to prevent damage or misalignment.
For further guidance see Approved Document H1 paragraph 2.24.
"Where the drain or sewer is more than 2m deep to invert and passes beneath the foundations, the foundations should be designed as a lintel spanning over the line of the drain or sewer."
The span of the lintel should extend at least 1.5m either side of the pipe and should be designed so that no load is transmitted onto the drain or sewer.
A drain trench should not be excavated lower than the foundations of any building nearby.
For further guidance see Approved Document H1 paragraph 2.25.
"This Approved Document, which took effect on 1 April 2002, deals with the following Requirement which is contained in the Building Regulations 2010."
Any system for discharging water to a sewer which is provided pursuant to paragraph H3 shall be separate from that provided for the conveyance of foul water from the building.
Requirement H5 applies only to a system provided in connection with the erection or extension of a building where it is reasonably practicable for the system to discharge directly or indirectly to a sewer for the separate conveyance of surface water which is:
shown on a map of sewers; or
under construction either by the sewerage undertaker or by some other person (where the sewer is the subject of an agreement to make a declaration of vesting pursuant to Section 104 of the Water Industry Act 1991 (b)).
Section 104 was amended by Section 96 of the Schedule 9 to the Water Act 2003.
and is prospectively amended by Section 42 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (c. 29).
In the Secretary of State’s view the requirements of H5 will be met if separate systems of drains and sewers are provided for foul water and rainwater where:
the volume of rainwater entering the public foul sewer system as this can overload the capacity of the sewer and cause flooding.
the rainwater is not contaminated; and
the drainage is to be connected either directly or indirectly to the public sewer system and either:
the public sewer system in the area comprises separate systems for foul water and surface water; or
a system of sewers which provides for the separate conveyance of surface water is under construction either by the sewerage undertaker or by some other person (where the sewer is the subject of an agreement to make a declaration of vesting pursuant to Section 104 of the Water Industry Act 1991).
"Where the buildings are to be drained to the public sewer system, and the sewerage undertaker has provided a separate system of sewers, separate drainage systems will be necessary in order to comply with the requirements of Section 106 (Right to communicate with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991 (see appendix H1-C paragraph C.7)."
Separate foul and rainwater drainage 1.2 systems should also be provided where there is a combined sewer system at present but a system of sewers which provides for the separate conveyance of surface water is under construction either by the sewerage undertaker or by some other person (where the sewer is the subject of an agreement to make declaration of vesting pursuant to Section 104 of the Water Industry Act 1991).
These separate drainage systems will both 1.3 initially connect to the existing combined sewer system.
"However, when the separate sewer systems are completed, the drainage will be reconnected to the new sewers, minimising the disruption to the occupiers."
Approved Document H3 paragraph 3.21 1.4 deals with drainage from areas where materials are stored which could contaminate runoff.
This could cause pollution if discharged to a surface water sewer.
"Where such flows are to be discharged into the foul sewer system, the consent of the sewerage undertaker should first be obtained in accordance with Section 106 (Right to communicate with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991 (see appendix H1-C paragraph C.7)."
"The sewerage undertaker should also be consulted where such flows are to be discharged into a foul drain which, though it would initially connect to a combined sewer, is intended would eventually be reconnected to a proposed foul sewer."
"This Approved Document, which took effect on 1 April 2002, deals with the following Requirement which is contained in the Building Regulations 2010."
Adequate provision shall be made for storage of solid waste.
Adequate means of access shall be provided:
for people in the building to the place of storage; and
from the place of storage to a collection point (where one has been specified by the waste collection authority under Section 46 (household waste) or Section 47 (commercial waste) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (a) or to a street (where no collection point has been specified).
43; section 46 was amended by Section 19 of the London Local Authorities Act 2007 (2007 c. ii) and Section 47 was amended by Section 21 of that Act.
Section 46 was also amended by Section 76 and Schedule 5 to the Climate Change Act 2008 (c. 28).
In the Secretary of State’s view the requirements of H6 will be met if the solid waste storage is:
designed and sited so as not to be prejudicial to health or local amenity;
of sufficient area having regard to the requirements of the waste collection authority for the number and size of receptacles under Sections 46 and 47 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990;
sited so as to be accessible for use by people in the building and of ready access for removal to the collection point specified by the waste collection authority under Sections 46 and 47 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
dependent on its capacity and the ease of removal in relation to the collection service provided by the waste collection authority.
The waste collection authority has powers 0.2 under Section 46 (Receptacles for household waste) and Section 47 (Receptacles for commercial or industrial waste) to specify the type and number of receptacles to be used and the location where the waste should be placed for collection.
Consultation should take place with the waste collection authority to determine their requirements.
applies to the erection or extension of a building and to all material changes of use described in Regulation 5.
For domestic developments space should 1.1 be provided for storage of containers for separated waste (i.e. waste which can be recycled is stored separately from waste which cannot) with a combined capacity of 0.25m³ per dwelling or such other capacity as may be agreed with the waste collection authority.
"Where collections are less frequent than once per week, this allowance should be increased accordingly."
"Low rise domestic developments – 1.2 In low rise domestic developments (houses, bungalows and flats up to 4th floor) any dwelling should have, or have access to, a location where at least two movable individual or communal waste containers, meeting the requirements of the waste collection authority, can be stored."
"Where separate storage areas are provided for each dwelling, an area of 1.2m x 1.2m should be sufficient to provide for storage of waste containers and provide space for access."
Where communal storage areas are provided space requirements should be determined in consultation with the waste collection authority.
High rise domestic developments – in multi-storey domestic developments dwellings up to the 4th floor may each have their own waste container or may share a waste container.
"Dwellings above the 4th storey may share a single waste container for non-recyclable waste fed by chute, with separate storage for any waste which can be recycled."
Alternatively storage compounds or rooms should be provided.
In such a case a satisfactory management arrangement for conveying refuse to the storage area should be assured.
"The use of ‘Residents Only’ recycling 1.7 centres (areas where residents may bring their recyclable waste for storage in large containers, e.g. bottle banks) in large blocks has been found to be effective in some areas."
Storage areas for waste containers and 1.8 chutes should be sited so that the distance householders are required to carry refuse does not usually exceed 30m (excluding any vertical distance).
Containers should be within 25m of the waste collection point specified by the waste collection authority.
"The location for storage of waste 1.9 containers should be sited so that, unless it is completely unavoidable, the containers can be taken to the collection point without being taken through a building, unless it is a porch or garage, or a car port or other open covered space (this provision applies only to new buildings except that extensions or conversions should not remove such a facility where one already exists)."
"For waste containers up to 250 litres, steps should be avoided between the container store and collection point wherever possible and should not exceed 3 in number."
Slopes should not exceed 1:12.
Exceptionally this may be exceeded provided that the lengths are not excessive and it is not part of a series of slopes.
For storage areas where larger containers are to be used steps should be avoided.
"Where this is not otherwise possible, the storage area should be relocated."
The collection point should be reasonably accessible to the size of waste collection vehicles typically used by the waste collection authority.
External storage areas for waste containers should be away from windows and ventilators and preferably be in shade or under shelter.
Storage areas should not interfere with pedestrian or vehicle access to buildings.
"Unsightly bins can damage the visual amenity of an area and contribute to increased levels of anti-social nuisance such as odour and litter, so bin storage should be planned carefully."
Where the location for storage is in a publicly accessible area or in an open area around a building (e.g. in a front garden) an enclosure or shelter should be considered.
Best practice guidance is given in NHBC Foundation report NF60.
"Where enclosures, compounds or storage rooms are provided they should allow room for filling and emptying and provide a clear space of 150mm between and around the containers."
"Enclosures, compounds or storage rooms for communal containers should be a minimum of 2m high."
Enclosures for individual containers should be sufficiently high to allow the lid to be opened for filling.
The enclosure should be permanently ventilated at the top and bottom and should have a paved impervious floor.
Communal storage areas should have provision for washing down and draining the floor into a system suitable for receiving a polluted effluent.
Gullies should incorporate a trap which maintains a seal even during prolonged periods of disuse.
Any room for the open storage of waste should be secure to prevent access by vermin.
Any compound for the storage of waste should be secure to prevent access by vermin unless the waste is to be stored in secure containers with close fitting lids.
"Where storage rooms are provided, separate rooms should be provided for the storage of waste which cannot be recycled, and waste which can be recycled."
High-rise domestic developments – where chutes are provided they should be at least 450mm diameter and should have a smooth non-absorbent surface and close fitting access doors at each storey which has a dwelling and be ventilated at the top and bottom.
"In other types of development, and 1.19 particularly where special problems such as high density developments influence the provision of a system, it is essential that the waste collection authority is consulted for guidance on resolving the following points."
"The volume and nature of the waste and the storage capacity required, based on the frequency of collection and the size and type of waste container."
Any requirements for segregation of waste which can be recycled.
"The method of waste storage, including any on-site treatment proposed, related to the intended layout and building density."
"The location of waste storage areas, waste treatment areas and waste collection points and the access to these locations for operatives and vehicles."
Hygiene arrangements in the waste storage and waste treatment areas.
Fire hazards and protection measures.
Waste storage areas should have an impervious floor and should have provision for washing down and draining the floor into a system suitable for receiving a polluted effluent.
Gullies should incorporate a trap which maintains a seal even during prolonged periods of disuse.
Any room for the open storage of waste should be secure to prevent access by vermin.
Any compound for the storage of waste should be secure to prevent access by vermin unless the waste is to be stored in secure containers with close fitting lids.
Waste storage areas should be marked and signs should be provided.
Recommendations and data on these items can be found in BS 5906:2005 Code of practice for waste management in buildings.
"Under Section 45 (Collection of controlled waste) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities have a general duty to collect household waste within their area without charge."
"Under Section 46 (Receptacles for household waste) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the local authority may require:"
waste of certain types to be stored separately so that it can be recycled;
occupiers of dwellings to provide containers of a specified type for storage of waste;
additional containers to be provided for separate storage of recyclable waste;
locations where containers should be placed for emptying.
"Under Section 45 (Collection of controlled waste) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities may also have a duty to collect commercial waste within their area where requested and they may also collect industrial waste."
A charge may be levied for such services.
"Under Section 47 (Receptacles for commercial or industrial waste) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the local authority may still require:"
waste of certain types to be stored separately so that it can be recycled;
occupiers to provide containers of a specified type for storage of waste;
additional containers to be provided for separate storage of recyclable waste;
locations where containers should be placed for emptying.
"Under Section 23 (Provision of facilities for refuse) subsection (3) of the Building Act 1984, it is unlawful to obstruct the access (such as those specified in Requirement H6 of the Building Regulations) provided for removal of waste without the consent of the local authority."
"In giving their consent, the local authority may specify conditions regarding the provision of an alternative means of access for removal of refuse."

"This Approved Document, which takes effect on 1 October 2010, deals with combustion appliances and fuel storage systems in the Building Regulations 2010 (as amended)."
"Limitation on requirements In accordance with regulation 8 of the Building Regulations, the requirements in Parts A to D, F to K and N and P (except for paragraphs G2, H2 and J6) of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations do not require anything to be done except for the purpose of securing reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about buildings (and any others who may be affected by buildings or matters connected with buildings)."
Paragraph G2 is excluded from regulation 8 as it deals with the conservation of water.
Paragraphs H2 and J6 are excluded from regulation 8 because they deal directly with prevention of the contamination of water and of oil pollution.
"Parts E and M (which deal, respectively, with resistance to the passage of sound and access to and use of buildings) are excluded from regulation 8 because they address the welfare and convenience of building users."
Part L is excluded from regulation 8 because it addresses the conservation of fuel and power.
"All these matters are amongst the purposes, other than health and safety that may be addressed by Building Regulations."
"Building work, as defined in regulation 3 of the Building Regulations 2010, includes the erection and extension of a building, the provision or extension of a controlled service or fitting, and the material alteration of a building or a controlled service or fitting."
"In addition, Building Regulations may apply in cases where the purposes for which or the manner or circumstances in which a building or part of a building is used change in the way that constitutes a material change of use."
"Under regulation 4 of the Building Regulations 2010 (as amended), building work should be carried out in such a way that, on completion of work,"
"the building complies with the applicable Parts of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations,"
"in the case of an extension or material alteration of a building, or the provision, extension or material alteration of a controlled service or fitting, where it did not comply with any such requirement, it is no more unsatisfactory in relation to that requirement than before the work was carried out."
Work described in Part J concerns the provision or extension of controlled services or fittings.
Work associated with installations covered in these sections may be subject to other relevant Parts of the Building Regulations.
Material change of use A material change of use occurs in specified circumstances in which a building or part of a building that was previously used for one purpose will be used in future for another.
Where there is a material change of use the Building Regulations set requirements that must be met before the building can be used for its new purpose.
Regulation 5 of the Building Regulations specifies the following circumstances as material changes of use:
• a building is used as a dwelling where previously it was not.
• a building contains a flat where previously it did not.
• a building is used as an hotel or boarding house where previously it was not.
• a building is used as an institution where previously it was not.
• a building is used as a public building where previously it was not.
• a building no longer comes within the exemptions in Schedule 2 to the Building Regulations where previously it did.
• a building which contains at least one dwelling contains a greater or lesser number of dwellings than it did previously.
• a building contains a room for residential purposes where previously it did not.
• a building which contains at least one room for residential puposes contains a greater or lesser number of such rooms than it did previously.
• a building is used as a shop where previously it was not.
Parts J1 to J4 will apply to all the material changes of use mentioned above which means that whenever such changes occur the building must be brought up to the standards required by Parts J1 to J4.
Buildings included in the schedule of monuments maintained under section 1 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 are exempt from compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.
There are other classes of buildings where special consideration may be needed in deciding what is adequate provision for compliance with Part J:
buildings situated in designated conservation areas;
buildings which are of architectural or historic interest and which are referred to as a material consideration in a local authority’s development plan; and
"buildings of architectural and historical interest within national parks, areas of outstanding or natural beauty and world heritage sites."
It would not normally be considered appropriate to relax the requirements of Part J since they relate to health and safety.
"However, it may be necessary to seek alternative technical solutions to those set out in this approved document in order to achieve reasonable standards of safety without prejudicing the character of the host building or increasing the risk of long-term deterioration of the building’s fabric or fittings."
"In determining what is appropriate in the circumstances, the advice of the local authority’s conservation officer should be sought."
The views of the conservation officer are particularly important where building work requires planning permission and/or listed building consent.
In almost all cases of new building work it will be necessary to notify a Building Control Body (BCB) in advance of any work starting.
"There are two exceptions to this: where work is carried out under a self-certification scheme listed in Schedule 3, and where work is listed in Schedule 4 to the Building Regulations as being not notifiable."
Under regulation 12(6) of the Building Regulations it is not necessary to notify a BCB in advance of work which is covered by this Approved Document if that work is of a type set out in column 1 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations and is carried out by a person registered with a relevant self-certification (competent persons) scheme as set out in column 2 of that Schedule.
"In order to join such a scheme a person must demonstrate competence to carry out the type of work the scheme covers, and also the ability to comply with all relevant requirements in the Building Regulations."
There are a number of schemes authorised for the installation of combustion appliances.
competent-person-schemes.
Full details of the schemes can be found on the individual scheme websites.
"Regulations 2010 require that the occupier of the building be given, within 30 days of the completion of the work, a certificate confirming that the work complies with all applicable Building Regulation requirements."
"There is a also requirement that the BCB be given a notice that this has been done, or a copy of the certificate, again within 30 days of the completion of the work."
These certificates and notices are usually made available through the scheme operator.
BCBs are authorised to accept these certificates as evidence of compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.
"However, local authority inspection and enforcement powers remain unaffected, although they are normally used only in response to a complaint that work does not comply."
Schedule 4 to the Building Regulations sets out types of work where there is no requirement to notify a BCB that work is to be carried out.
"These types of work are mainly of a minor nature where there is no significant risk to health, safety, water efficiency or energy efficiency."
"Health, safety, and energy efficiency requirements continue to apply to these types of work; only the need to notify a BCB has been removed."
"Where only non-notifiable work as set out in Schedule 4 is carried out, there is no requirement for a certificate confirming that the work complies with Building Regulation requirements to be given to the occupier or the BCB."
"In general, all work on a combustion appliance which is not a repair or maintenance will be notifiable work and Schedule 4 will not apply."
"However, it might be possible to add a control device to the appliance or to alter its electrical connection under the allowance in this schedule."
Local authority building control departments can give advice in cases of doubt.
"Schedule 2 to the Building Regulations sets out a number of classes of buildings which are exempt from all Building Regulations requirements, including those in Part J."

"Under the Clean Air Act 1993 as amended by the Environment Act 2021, local authorities may declare the whole or part of the district of the authority to be a smoke control area."
"This means that it is an offence to emit a substantial amount of smoke from a chimney of a building, from a furnace or from any fixed boiler if located in a designated smoke control area."
It is also an offence to acquire an ‘unauthorised fuel’ for use within a smoke control area unless it is used in an exempt appliance.
Authorised fuels are fuels which are authorised by Statutory Instruments (Regulations) made under the Clean Air Act 1993.
These include inherently smokeless fuels such as gas and anthracite together with specified brands of manufactured solid smokeless fuels.
These fuels have passed tests to confirm that they are capable of burning in an open fireplace without producing any smoke or a substantial quantity of smoke.
"Exempt appliances are appliances (ovens, wood burners, boilers and stoves) which have been exempted by Statutory Instruments (Orders) under the Clean Air Act 1993."
These have passed tests to confirm that they are capable of burning an unauthorised or inherently smoky solid fuel without producing any smoke or a substantial quantity of smoke.
The guidance in this Approved Document provides a way of ensuring that combustion appliances can function safely.
For combustion appliances to continue to work safely and effectively it is essential that they are adequately and regularly serviced and maintained.
"This Approved Document, which takes effect on 1 October 2010, deals with the following Requirements which are contained in the Building Regulations 2010 (as amended by SI 2001/2214)."
Requirements J1 and J2 apply only to fixed combustion appliances (including incinerators).
Requirement J3 applies only to fixed combustion appliances located in dwellings.
Requirement J6 applies only to:
fixed oil storage tanks with capacities greater than 90 litres and connecting pipes; and
"fixed liquefied petroleum gas storage installations with capacities greater than 150 litres and connecting pipes, which are located outside the building and which serve fixed combustion appliances (including incinerators) in the building."
"Requirement J7 applies only to fixed oil storage tanks with capacities of 3500 litres or less, and connecting pipes, which:"
are located outside the building; and
"serve fixed combustion appliances (including incinerators) in a building used wholly or mainly as a private dwelling, but does not apply to buried systems."
"Combustion appliances shall be so installed that there is an adequate supply of air to them for combustion, to prevent overheating and for the efficient working of any flue."
Combustion appliances shall have adequate provision for the discharge of products of combustion to the outside air.
"Where a fixed combustion appliance is provided, appropriate provision shall be made to detect and give warning of the release of carbon monoxide."
"Combustion appliances and fluepipes shall be so installed, and fireplaces and chimneys shall be so constructed and installed, as to reduce to a reasonable level the risk of people suffering burns or the building catching fire in consequence of their use."
"Where a hearth, fireplace, flue or chimney is provided or extended, a durable notice containing information on the performance capabilities of the hearth, fireplace, flue or chimney shall be affixed in a suitable place in the building for the purpose of enabling combustion appliances to be safely installed."
Liquid fuel storage systems and the pipes connecting them to combustion appliances shall be so constructed and separated from buildings and the boundary of the premises as to reduce to a reasonable level the risk of the fuel igniting in the event of fire in adjacent buildings or premises.
Oil storage tanks and the pipes connecting them to combustion appliances shall: (a) be so constructed and protected as to reduce to a reasonable level the risk of the oil escaping and causing pollution; and
have affixed in a prominent position a durable notice containing information on how to respond to an oil escape so as to reduce to a reasonable level the risk of pollution.
Particular reference should be made to:
Approved Document B for guidance on compartmentation of buildings for fire safety purposes and for appropriate degrees of fire resistance for compartment boundaries.
"Approved Document F for guidance on ventilation for health, and provision of extract ventilation using open flued combustion appliances."
"on how to satisfy the requirements of Part J. Although Part J applies to the accommodation of any combustion installation and liquid fuel storage system within the Limits on Application, the guidance in this Approved Document has been prepared mainly with domestic installations in mind, such as those comprising space and water heating systems and cookers and their flues, and their attendant oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel storage systems."
Part J does not include specific provisions relating to the storage of solid fuel (including solid biofuel) but the relevant guidance in Approved Document B should be followed.
The guidance applies to combustion 0.2 installations having power ratings and fuel storage capacities up to the limits shown in a) to c) below.
Guidance which applies generally is given in this section and Section 1.
More specific guidance is then given in:
Section 2 for solid fuel installations of up to 45kW rated output;
Section 3 for gas installations of up to 70kW net (77.7kW gross) rated input;
Section 4 for oil installations of up to 45kW rated heat output.
"Section 5 gives guidance on requirement J5 for heating oil storage installations with capacities up to 3500 litres and LPG storage installations with capacities up to 1.1 tonne, although there is no size limit on the application of requirement J5."
"Section 5 also gives guidance on requirement J6, which is limited to installations where the capacity of the oil storage tank is 3500 litres or less, serving buildings used wholly or mainly as private dwellings."
"For installations subject to the requirements 0.3 of part J but outside the scope of this Approved Document, such as incinerators or installations with higher ratings than those mentioned above, specialist guidance may be necessary."

adopted solely for the purposes of providing clarity in this Approved Document.
The following definitions have been 1.
An appliance compartment is an enclosure specifically constructed or adapted to accommodate one or more combustion appliances.
A balanced compartment is a method of installing an open-flued appliance into a compartment which is sealed from the remainder of the building and whose ventilation is so arranged in conjunction with the appliance flue as to achieve a balanced flue effect.
"sealed appliance which draws its combustion air from a point outside the building adjacent to the point at which the combustion products are discharged, the inlet and outlet being so disposed that wind effects are substantially balanced."
"Balanced flues may run vertically, but in the most common configuration they discharge horizontally through the external wall against which the appliance is situated."
The boundary is the boundary of the land or buildings belonging to and under the control of the building owner.
"Depending upon the paragraphs of this Approved Document to which it applies, it may be drawn only around the perimeter of the land in question or extended to the centreline of adjacent routes or waterways as shown in Diagram 1."
A Building Control Body is a body that carries out checks for compliance with the Building Regulations on plans of building work and on the building work itself.
The Building Control Body may be either the local authority or an Approved Inspector.
"For further details, see the manual to the Building Regulations."
The capacity of an oil tank is its nominal capacity as stated by the manufacturer.
It is usually 95 per cent of the volume of liquid required to fill it to the brim.

A chimney is a structure consisting of a wall or walls enclosing one or more flues (see Diagram 2).
"In the gas industry, the chimney for a gas appliance is commonly called the flue."
"A combustion appliance (or appliance) is an apparatus where fuel is burned to generate heat for space heating, water heating, cooking or other similar purpose."
The appliance does not include systems to deliver fuel to it or for the distribution of heat.
"Typical combustion appliances are boilers, warm air heaters, water heaters, fires, stoves and cookers."

Further information is given in Appendix G.
A draught break is an opening formed by a factory-made component into any part of the flue serving an open-flued appliance.
Such openings may be provided to allow dilution air to be drawn into a flue or to lessen the effects of down-draught on combustion in the appliance.
A draught diverter is a form of draught break intended to prevent conditions in the main length of flue from interfering with the combustion performance of an open-flued appliance (see Diagram 3(a)).
draughts that may occur in adverse wind conditions and excessive draught.
"A draught stabiliser is a factory-made counter-balanced flap device admitting air to the flue, from the same space as the combustion air, to prevent excessive variations in the draught (see Diagram 3(b))."
"It is usual for these to be in the fluepipe or chimney, but they may be located on the appliance."
as the area of a sharp-edged circular orifice which would pass the same air flow rate at the same applied pressure difference as the product or device being tested.
The equivalent area of a simple ventilator will be less than the geometrical free area and for complex products may be significantly less.
They are available in various materials and types ranging from single-walled metal chimneys suitable for some gas appliances to twin-walled chimneys with insulation sandwiched between an inner liner and an outer metal wall which are designed for oil or solid fuel use.
"In a fanned draught installation, the proper discharge of the flue gases depends upon the operation of a fan, which may be separately installed in the flue or may be an integral part of the combustion appliance."
Fans in combustion appliances either may extract flue gases from the combustion chamber or may cause the flue gases to be displaced from the combustion chamber if the fan is supplying it with air for combustion.
fired boilers) are also commonly referred to as forced draught appliances (see Diagram 4).
"Flues in fanned draught installations run horizontally or vertically and can be at higher or lower pressures than their surroundings, dependent upon the location of the fan."
"A fire compartment is a building or part of a building comprising one or more rooms, spaces or storeys constructed to prevent the spread of fire to or from another part of the same building or an adjoining building."
A separated part of a building is a form of compartmentation in which part of a building is separated from another part of the same building by a compartment wall.
Such walls run the full height of the part and are in one vertical plane.
Further information on this is given in Approved Document B Vol 2 (see Section 8 Compartmentation and Appendix C Methods of Measurement).
"A fireplace recess is a structural opening (sometimes called a builder’s opening) formed in a wall or in a chimney breast, from which a chimney leads and which has a hearth at its base."
"Simple structural openings (Diagram 5(a)) are suitable for closed appliances such as stoves, cookers or boilers, but gathers (Diagram 5(b)) are necessary for accommodating open fires."
Fireplace recesses are often lined with firebacks to accommodate inset open fires (Diagram 5(c)).
Lining components and decorative treatments fitted around openings reduce the opening area.
It is the finished fireplace opening area which determines the size of flue required for an open fire in such a recess.
The fire resistance of a component or construction is a measure of its ability to withstand the effects of fire in one or more ways for a stated period of time.
Guidance on determination of performance in terms of fire resistance is given in Approved Document B (Fire Safety).
A fire wall is a means of shielding a fuel tank from the thermal radiation from a fire.
"For LPG tanks, it also ensures that gas accidentally leaking from the tank or fittings must travel by a longer path and therefore disperse safely, before reaching a hazard such as an opening in a building, a boundary or other potential ignition source."
A flue is a passage that conveys the products of combustion from an appliance to the outside air (see Diagram 2).
"Flueblock chimney systems consist of a set of factory-made components, made from precast concrete, clay or other masonry units, that are designed for assembly on site to provide a complete chimney having the performance appropriate for the intended appliance."
"burning appliances and the other, often called chimney block systems, being primarily designed for solid fuel-burning appliances."
"A flue box is a factory made unit, usually made of metal, which is similar to a prefabricated appliance chamber except that it is designed to accommodate a gas burning appliance in conjunction with a factory-made chimney."
A flueless appliance is one which is designed to be used without connection to a flue.
Its products of combustion mix with the surrounding room air and are eventually transported to the outside as stale air leaves the room (see Diagram 4(g)).
"A flue liner is the wall of the chimney that is in contact with the products of combustion (see Diagram 2), such as a concrete flue liner, the inner liner of a factory-made chimney system or a flexible liner fitted into an existing chimney."
"A flue outlet is the point at which the products of combustion are discharged from the flue to the outside atmosphere, such as the top of a chimney pot or flue terminal."
"A fluepipe is a pipe, either single walled (bare or insulated) or double walled, which connects a combustion appliance to a flue in a chimney."
"For clarity, when used in this way, it may be called a connecting fluepipe."
(Fluepipe is also used to describe the tubular components from which some factory made chimneys for gas and oil appliances are made or from which plastic flue systems are made).
"A hearth is a base intended to safely isolate a combustion appliance from people, combustible parts of the building fabric and soft furnishings."
The exposed surface of the hearth provides a region around the appliance which can be kept clear of anything at risk of fire.
"The body of the hearth may be thin insulating board, a substantial thickness of material such as concrete or some intermediate provision dependent upon the weight and downward heat emission characteristics of the appliance(s) upon it (see Diagram 6)."
The heat input rate is the maximum rate of energy flow into an appliance.
It is calculated as the rate of fuel flow to the appliance multiplied by either the fuel’s gross or net calorific value.
"Note: Traditionally, the UK has used Gross values, most European standards use Net values."
Thus for gas appliances it is now the norm to express this rating as a net value (kW (net)).
Installation instructions are those instructions produced by manufacturers to enable installers to correctly install and test appliances and flues and to commission them into service.
the flue and the temperature of the ambient air.
Taller flues produce a greater draught at their base.
"Except for those balanced flue appliances which are designed to discharge directly through the wall adjacent to the appliance, a satisfactory natural draught requires an essentially vertical run of flue (see Diagram 4 (a) and (b))."
This is the highest level of reaction to fire performance.
-combustible materials include:
any material which when tested to BS 476-11:1982 (2007) does not flame nor cause any rise in temperature on either the centre (specimen) or furnace thermocouples; and
products classified as non-combustible in tests following the procedures in BS 476-4:1970 (2007);
any material classified as class A1 in accordance with BS EN 13501-1:2002 Fire classification of construction products and building elements.
Classification using data from reaction to fire tests.
"Typical examples of such materials to be found in buildings include totally inorganic materials such as concrete, fired clay, ceramics, metals, plaster and masonry containing not more than 1 per cent by weight or volume of organic material."
More detailed information is given in Approved Document B (Fire Safety).
"A Notified Body, for the purposes of the Gas Appliances (Safety) Regulations (1995), means:"
a body which is approved by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry as being competent to carry out the required Attestation procedures for gas appliances and whose name and identification number has been notified by him/her to the Commission of the European Community and to other member States in accordance with the Gas Appliances (Safety) Regulations (1995);
a body which has been similarly approved for the purposes of the Gas Appliances Directive by another member State and whose name and identification number has been notified to the Commission and to other member States pursuant to the Gas Appliances Directive.
"An open-flued appliance is one which draws its combustion air from the room or space within which it is installed and which requires a flue to discharge its products of combustion to the outside air (see Diagram 4 (a), (c) and (e))."
"A prefabricated appliance chamber is a set of factory-made precast concrete components designed to provide a fireplace recess to accommodate an appliance such as a stove, and incorporates a gather when used with an open fire."
The chamber is normally positioned against a wall and may be designed to support a chimney.
The chamber and chimney are often enclosed to create a false chimney breast (see also ‘flue box’).
"The rated heat input (sometimes shortened to rated input) for a gas appliance is the maximum heat input rate at which it can be operated, as declared on the appliance data plate."
The rated heat output for an oil appliance is the maximum declared energy output rate (kW) as declared on the appliance data plate.
The rated heat output for a solid fuel appliance is the manufacturer’s declared nominal energy output rate (kW) for the appliance.
This may be different for different fuels.
"A room-sealed appliance means an appliance whose combustion system is sealed from the room in which the appliance is located and which obtains air for combustion from a ventilated uninhabited space within the building or directly from the open air outside the building and which vents the products of combustion directly to open air outside the building (see Diagram 4 (b), (d) and (f))."
"Solid biofuel means, for the purpose of this Approved Document, a solid fuel derived from plants and trees."
"It can include logs, wood chips, wood pellets and other processed plant material."
A throat is a contracted part of the flue between a fireplace recess and its chimney (see Diagram 22).
Throats are usually formed from prefabricated components as shown in Diagram 29.
should be measured at right angles to the direction in which gases flow.
"Where offset components are used, they should not reduce the flue area to less than the minimum required for the combustion appliance (see Diagram 7)."
requirements J1 to J5 will be met if the building provisions for the safe accommodation of combustion appliances:
enable the admission of sufficient air for:
the proper combustion of fuel and the operation of flues; and
the cooling of appliances where necessary;
enable normal operation of appliances without the products of combustion becoming a hazard to health.
"incorporate an appropriate means of warning of a release of carbon monoxide for fixed appliances that burn solid fuels, gas fuels (excluding gas appliances used solely for cooking) and oil fuels;"
enable normal operation of appliances without their causing danger through damage by heat or fire to the fabric of the building;
have been inspected and tested to establish suitability for the purpose intended;
have been labelled to indicate performance capabilities.
"Note: Whilst, for the purposes of requirement J3, it is considered appropriate to require carbon monoxide alarms only when fixed appliances that burn solid fuel, gas (excluding gas appliances used solely for cooking) and oil are installed, such alarms can still reduce the risk of poisoning from other types of appliance."
Combustion appliances require ventilation to supply them with air for combustion.
"Ventilation is also required to ensure the proper operation of flues or, in the case of flueless appliances, to ensure that the products of combustion are safely dispersed to the outside air."
Installation of room-sealed appliances or those with a directly connected ducted external air supply will minimise ventilation energy losses from the room and the risk of cold draughts.
"In some cases, combustion appliances may also require air for cooling control systems and/or to ensure that casings remain safe to touch (see Diagram 8). General guidance on where it may be necessary to install air vents for these purposes is given below."
"Air vent sizes, which are dependent upon 1.3 the type of fuel burned, are given in Sections 2, 3 and 4 and are for one combustion appliance only."
The air supply provisions will usually need to be increased where a room contains more than one appliance (such as a kitchen containing an open-flued boiler and an open-flued cooker).
may need permanently open air vents.
flued appliance must receive a certain amount of air from outside (‘combustion air’ in Diagram 8) dependent upon its type and rating.
"Infiltration through the building fabric may be sufficient but for certain appliance ratings and forms of construction, permanent openings are necessary (see Diagram 8)."
"Appliance compartments that enclose open-flued combustion appliances should be provided with vents large enough to admit all of the air required by the appliance for combustion and proper flue operation, whether the compartment draws its air from a room or directly from outside (see Diagram 8 (b) and (c))."
"Where appliances require cooling air, appliance compartments should be large enough to enable air to circulate and high- and low-level vents should be provided (see Diagram 8 (d), (e), (f) and (g))."
"Where appliances are to be installed within balanced compartments (see paragraph 0.4(2)), special provisions will be necessary and the appliance and ventilation system manufacturer’s instructions should be followed."
"If an appliance is room-sealed but takes its 1.8 combustion air from another space in the building (such as the roof void) or if a flue has a permanent opening to another space in the building (such as where it feeds a secondary flue in the roof void), that space should have ventilation openings directly to outside."
"Where the roof-space is to be used as a source of air for a combustion installation serving a dwelling, the dwelling roof ventilation provisions suggested in Approved Document C would normally be satisfactory."
"Where flued appliances are supplied with combustion air through air vents which open into adjoining rooms or spaces, the adjoining rooms or spaces should have air vent openings of at least the same size direct to the outside."
"Air vents for flueless appliances, however, should open directly to the outside air."
(as measured in (b)) or the duct area.
"Permanently open air vents should be non-adjustable, sized to admit sufficient air for the purpose intended and positioned where they are unlikely to become blocked."
Ventilators should be installed so that building occupants are not provoked into sealing them against draughts or noise.
Ventilation openings should not be made in fire-resisting walls other than external walls (although they should not penetrate those parts of external walls shielding LPG tanks).
Air vents should not be located within a fireplace recess except on the basis of specialist advice.
"A way of meeting the requirement would be to size permanently open air vents so that their equivalent area is sufficient for the appliance(s) to be installed (taking account where necessary of obstructions such as grilles and anti-vermin mesh), and to site them:"
outside fireplace recesses and beyond the hearths of open fires so that dust or ash will not be disturbed by draughts; and
in a location unlikely to cause discomfort from cold draughts.
"Where ventilation is to be provided via a single proprietary assembly, for example when it is proposed to use a proprietary ventilator with integral grilles to bridge a cavity wall, the equivalent area of the ventilator should be taken as that declared by the manufacturer having been measured by the method in BS EN 13141-1:2004."
"Where two or more components are to be used to provide a non-proprietary assembly, the assembly should be kept as simple and smooth as possible."
The assembly should be taken to have an equivalent area equal to that of the component with the smallest equivalent area in the assembly.
"The equivalent area stated in the ventilator manufacturer’s literature or marked on the air vent should be used whenever it is available, as this can differ considerably from the free area measured at one end of the air vent."
"When this is not available the equivalent area of a simple ventilator with no internal baffles can be taken as the total unobstructed cross-sectional area, measured in the plane where this area is at a minimum and at right angles to the direction of air flow."
"For an airbrick, grille or louvre with apertures no smaller than 5mm, it will be the aggregate free area of the individual apertures as shown Diagram 9."
Grilles or meshes protecting air vents from the entry of animals or birds should have aperture dimensions no smaller than 5mm.
"Discomfort from cold draughts can be avoided by supplying air directly to appliances, locating vents close to appliances (for example by using floor vents), by drawing air from intermediate spaces such as hallways or by ensuring good mixing of incoming cold air by placing external air vents close to ceilings (see Diagrams 10 and 11)."
In noisy areas it may be necessary to install noise-attenuated ventilators to limit the entry of noise into the building.
Transfer or connecting ventilation should be at low level to reduce the transfer of smoke in the event of a fire and otherwise meet the guidance given in Approved Document B.
Buildings may have air-tight membranes in their floors to isolate them from the ground below.
Ventilation ducts or vents installed to supply air to combustion appliances should not penetrate these membranes in a way that will render them ineffective.
"proof membranes) are described in BRE Report BR 414 (2001) and BRE Report BR 211 (2007), which give guidance when service penetrations are necessary."
"Rooms or spaces intended to contain open-flued combustion appliances may need permanent ventilation to comply with Part J and adjustable ventilation to comply with Part F. Permanently open air vents for combustion appliances can be accepted in place of some or all of the adjustable background ventilation for health, dependent upon opening area and location."
However adjustable vents installed to meet the requirements of Part F cannot be used as substitutes for the ventilation openings needed to comply with Part J unless they are fixed permanently open.
Rooms or spaces intended to contain flueless appliances may need: permanent ventilation and purge ventilation (such as openable windows) to comply with Part J; and adjustable ventilation and rapid ventilation to comply with Part F. Permanent ventilation provisions to comply with Part J may be acceptable in place of adjustable ventilation provisions for Part F subject to the limitations described in Paragraph 1.18.
"Openable elements installed for the rapid ventilation of rooms and other provisions made for the rapid ventilation of kitchens, in order to comply with Part F, may be acceptable in place of openable elements for the rapid ventilation of rooms or spaces containing flueless appliances."
Diagram 11 Provision of permanent air vent openings in a solid floor
"Extract fans lower the pressure in a building, which can cause the spillage of combustion products from open-flued appliances."
This can occur even if the appliance and the fan are in different rooms.
"Ceiling fans produce air currents and hence local depressurisation, which can also cause the spillage of flue gases from open-flued appliances or from solid fuel open fires."
"In buildings where it is intended to install open-flued combustion appliances and extract fans, the combustion appliances should be able to operate safely whether or not the fans are running."
"A way of showing compliance in these circumstances would be to follow the installation guidance below, and to show by tests that combustion appliances operate safely whether or not fans are running."
"For gas appliances: where a kitchen contains an open-flued appliance, the extract rate of the kitchen extract fan should not exceed 20 litres/second (72m³/hour)."
For oil appliances: where a room contains an open-flued appliance the extract rate should be limited to 40 litres/second for an appliance with a pressure jet burner and 20 litres/second for an appliance with a vaporising burner.
For solid fuel appliances: avoid installing extract ventilation in the same room.
An open-flued appliance in a kitchen may satisfy the requirements of Part F through passive stack ventilation.
Refer to Approved Document F. If mechanical extraction is unavoidable then seek specialist advice to ensure safe operation of the appliance.
"For commercial and industrial installations, specialist advice may be necessary regarding the possible need for the interlocking of gas heaters and any mechanical ventilation systems."
When fans are used to extract radon from below a building follow the guidance in BRE Good Building Guide GBG 25.
A suitable test would be to check for spillage when appliances are subjected to the greatest possible depressurisation.
"A prerequisite for this condition is that all external doors, windows and other adjustable ventilators to outside are closed."
"The depressurisation at the appliance will depend on the particular combination of fans in operation (fans in the room containing the appliance and fans elsewhere in the building) and the pattern of open internal doors, hatches etc. which is established at the time of the test (when fans should be on their maximum useable setting), and the specific combination causing the greatest depressurisation at the appliance depends upon the circumstances in each case."
Several tests (which should include a test with the door leading into the room of installation closed and all fans in that room switched on) may therefore be necessary to demonstrate the safe operation of the appliance with reasonable certainty.
The effect of ceiling fans should be checked during the tests.
"The presence of some fans may be obvious, such as those on view in kitchens, but others may be less obvious: fans installed in domestic appliances such as tumble dryers and fans fitted to other open-flued combustion appliances can also contribute to depressurisation."
"In addition, fans may also be provided to draw radon gas from the ground below a building (see Paragraph 1.17)."
clay flue liners with rebates or sockets for jointing meeting the requirements for Class A1 N2 or Class A1 N1 as described in BS EN 1457:2009; or
"concrete flue liners meeting the requirements for the classification Type A1, Type A2, Type B1 or Type B2 as described in BS EN 1857:2003; or"
other products that meet the criteria in a).
Liners should be installed in accordance with their manufacturer’s instructions.
Appropriate components should be selected to form the flue without cutting and to keep joints to a minimum.
Bends and offsets should be formed only with matching factory-made components.
Liners need to be placed with the sockets or rebate ends uppermost to contain moisture and other condensates in the flue.
"Joints should be sealed with fire cement, refractory mortar or installed in accordance with their manufacturer’s instructions."
Spaces between the lining and the surrounding masonry should not be filled with ordinary mortar.
"In the absence of liner manufacturer’s instructions, the space could be filled with a weak insulating concrete such as mixtures of:"
"one part ordinary Portland cement to 20 parts suitable lightweight expanded clay aggregate, minimally wetted; or"
one part ordinary Portland cement to 6 parts Vermiculite; or
one part ordinary Portland cement to 10 parts Perlite.
Flueblock chimneys should be constructed of factory-made components suitable for the intended application installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Ways of meeting the requirement for solid fuel appliances (and generally suitable for other fuels) include using:
"flueblocks whose performance is at least equal to that corresponding to the designation T400 N2 D 3 G, as described in BS EN 1443:2003, such as:"
other products that meet the criteria in a).
blocks suitable for the purpose lined in accordance with Paragraph 1.27.
Joints should be sealed in accordance with the flueblock manufacturer’s instructions.
Bends and offsets should be formed only with matching factory-made components.
The appliance manufacturer’s installation instructions may describe a suitable spillage test for gas appliances but the procedure in BS 5440-1:2008 can be used.
"For oil-fired appliances the effects of fans can be checked and, where spillage or flue draught interference is identified, it may be necessary to add additional ventilation to the room or space."
"A flue draught interference test for oil-fired appliances is described in OFTEC Technical Books 2, 4 and 5."
Appliances other than flueless appliances should incorporate or be connected to suitable flues which discharge to the outside air.
"This Approved Document provides guidance on how to meet the requirements in terms of constructing a flue or chimney, where each flue serves one appliance only."
Flues designed to serve more than one appliance can meet the requirements by following the guidance in BS 5410-1:1997 for oil- and BS 5440-1:2008 for gas-fired systems.
"However, each solid fuel appliance should have its own flue."
Chimneys and flues should provide satisfactory control of water condensation.
Ways of providing satisfactory control include:
for chimneys that do serve condensing appliances:
making provisions for the disposal of condensate from condensing appliances.
New masonry chimneys should be constructed with flue liners and masonry suitable for the intended application.
"weight concrete blocks or stone (with wall thicknesses as given in Section 2, 3 or 4 according to the intended fuel) with suitable mortar joints for the masonry and suitably supported and caulked liners."
Liners suitable for solid fuel appliances (and generally suitable for other fuels) could be:
"liners whose performance is at least equal to that corresponding to the designation T400 N2 D 3 G, as described in BS EN 1443:2003, such as:"
Where a building is to be altered for different use (e.g. it is being converted into flats) the fire resistance of walls of existing masonry chimneys may need to be improved as shown in Diagram 12.
Satisfactory components for constructing connecting fluepipes include:
"metal flue pipes appropriately designated in accordance with BS EN1856-2:2004 to suit the appliance and types of fuels to be burnt – refer to detailed guidance in Sections 2, 3 and 4."
other fluepipes having the necessary performance designation for use with the intended appliance.
Fluepipes with spigot and socket joints should be fitted with the socket facing upwards to contain moisture and other condensates in the flue.
Joints should be made gas-tight.
combustible rope and fire cement.
"of building occupants that renovations, refurbishments or repairs to flue liners should result in flues that comply with the requirements of J2 to J5."
The test procedures referred to in paragraph 1.55 and in Appendix E can be used to check this.
"Flues are controlled services as defined in Regulation 2 of the Building Regulations, that is to say they are services in relation to which Part J of Schedule 1 imposes requirements."
"If renovation, refurbishment or repair amounts to or involves the provision of a new or replacement flue liner, it is ‘building work’ within the meaning of Regulation 3 of the Building Regulations."
‘Building work’ and must not be undertaken without prior notification to the local authority.
Examples of work that would need to be notified include:
a cast in situ liner that significantly alters the a. using component systems appropriately flue’s internal dimensions.
"Anyone in doubt about whether or not any renovation, refurbishment or repair work involving a flue is notifiable ‘building work’, could consult the building control department of their local authority, or an approved inspector."
"Where it is proposed to bring a flue in an existing chimney back into use or to re-use a flue with a different type or rating of appliance, the flue and the chimney should be checked and, if necessary, altered to ensure that they satisfy the requirements for the proposed use."
A way of checking before and/or after remedial work would be to test the flue using the procedures in Appendix E.
"A way of refurbishing defective flues would be to line them using the materials and components described in Sections 2, 3, and 4 dependent upon the type of combustion appliance proposed."
"Before relining flues, they should be swept to remove deposits."
A flue may also need to be lined to reduce the flue area to suit the intended appliance.
Oversize flues can be unsafe.
"If a chimney has been relined in the past 1.39 using a metal lining system and the appliance is being replaced, the metal liner should also be replaced unless the metal liner can be proven to be recently installed and can be seen to be in good condition."
"A way of relining a chimney would be to use a flexible metal flue liner, appropriately designated in accordance with BS EN1856-2:2004 to suit the appliance, fuel and flue gas characteristics."
Flexible flue liners should be used only to reline a chimney and should not be used as the primary liner of a new chimney.
They can be used to connect gas back boilers to chimneys where the appliance is located in a fireplace recess.
"A way of using plastic flue systems and liners would be to use a plastic flue, appropriately designated in accordance with BS EN 14471:2005 to suite the appliance, fuel and flue characteristics."
"Plastic fluepipe systems can be acceptable in some cases, for example with condensing boiler installations, where the fluepipes are supplied by or specified by the appliance manufacturer as being suitable for purpose."
Ways of meeting the requirements when proposing factory-made metal chimneys include:
1:2003 to suit the appliance and types of fuels to be burnt and installing them in accordance with the relevant recommendations of BS EN 15287-1:2007;
"using any other chimney system that is suitable for the intended purpose and installed in accordance with the relevant recommendations in BS EN 15287-1:2007 or BS 5440-1:2008, as appropriate to the type of appliance being installed."
"Where a factory-made metal chimney passes through a wall, sleeves should be provided to prevent damage to the flue or building through thermal expansion."
"To facilitate the checking of gas-tightness, joints between chimney sections should not be concealed within ceiling joist spaces or within the thicknesses of walls without proper access being provided (see paragraph 1.47)."
"When providing a factory-made metal chimney, provision should be made to withdraw the appliance without the need to dismantle the chimney."
Factory-made metal chimneys should be kept a suitable distance away from combustible materials.
Ways of meeting the requirement for chimneys designated to BS EN 1856-1:2003 comprise:
"locating the chimney not less than distance ‘xx’ from combustible material, where ‘xx’ is defined in BS EN 1856-1:2003 as shown in Diagram 13;"
"where a chimney passes through a cupboard, storage space or roof space, providing a guard placed no closer to the outer wall of the chimney than the distance in a) above."
"Where a factory-made metal chimney penetrates a fire compartment wall or floor, it must not breach the fire separation requirements of Part B. See Approved Document B for more guidance but the requirements may be met by:"
using a factory-made metal chimney of the appropriate level of fire resistance installed in accordance with BS EN 1856-1:2003 Annex NA; or
casing the chimney in non-combustible material giving at least half the fire resistance recommended for the fire compartment wall or floor.
"Where a flue is routed within a void, appropriate means of access at strategic locations should be provided to allow the following aspects to be visually checked and confirmed."
This is necessary both when an appliance is first installed and subsequently when the appliance is serviced:
• any required gradient of fall back to the boiler (required to recover the condensate produced as part of the combustion process) and any other required drain points have been provided.
"Means of access for flues needs to be sufficiently sized and positioned to allow a visual inspection to be undertaken of the flue, particularly at any joints in the flue."
It is not intended that the means of access should be sized to allow full physical access to the flue system.
Diagram 14 shows an acceptable approach for a flue in an ceiling void.
Flues should not pass through another dwelling since access for inspection may not always be available to that dwelling and chimney system running through it.
Flues may pass through communal areas including purpose-designed ducts where inspection access is provided.
"Any ‘means of access’ should not impair any fire, thermal or acoustic requirements of the Building Regulations."
"Refer to the relevant guidance in Approved Documents B, L and E. Where necessary, inspection panels or hatches should be fitted with resilient seals and provide the similar standards of fire, thermal and acoustic isolation to the surrounding structure."
Access hatches should be at least 300mm x 300mm or larger where necessary to allow sufficient access to the void to look along the length of the flue.
Digram 14 shows an acceptable approach to providing access to a horizontal flue located within a ceiling void.
measuring at least 300mm square.
"No flue joint within the void should be more than 1.5m distant from the edge of the nearest inspection hatch, i.e. dimension x in the diagram should be less than 1.5m."
Where possible inspection hatches should be located at changes of direction.
Where this is not possible then bends should be viewable from both directions.
Flue systems should offer least resistance to the passage of flue gases by minimising changes in direction or horizontal length.
A way of meeting the requirement would be to build flues so that they are straight and vertical except for the connections to combustion appliances with rear outlets where the horizontal section should not exceed 150mm.
"Where bends are essential, they should be angled at no more than 45° to the vertical."
Provisions should be made to enable flues to be swept and inspected.
"A way of making reasonable provision would be to limit the number of changes of direction between the combustion appliance outlet and the flue outlet to not more than four (each up to 45°), with not more than two of these being between an intended point of access for sweeping and either another point of access for sweeping or the flue outlet."
"(90° factory-made bends, elbows or Tee pieces in fluepipes may be treated as being equal to two 45° bends (see Diagram 15))."
A flue should not have openings into more than one room or space except for the purposes of:
inspection or cleaning; or
"fitting an explosion door, draught break, draught stabiliser or draught diverter."
"Openings for inspection and cleaning should be formed using purpose factory-made components compatible with the flue system, having an access cover that has the same level of gas-tightness as the flue system and an equal level of thermal insulation."
Openings for cleaning the flue should allow easy passage of the sweeping brush.
combustible except where fitted to a combustible fluepipe (such as a plastic fluepipe).
"After the appliance has been installed, it should be possible to sweep the whole flue."
Flues discharging at low level near boundaries should do so at positions where the building owner will always be able to ensure safe flue gas dispersal.
"A way of achieving this where owners of adjacent land could build up to the boundary would be to adopt the suggestions in Diagram 34 or 41, as relevant."
"Where a decorative treatment, such as a fireplace surround, masonry cladding or dry lining, is provided around a fireplace opening, any gaps that could allow flue gases to escape from the fireplace opening into the void behind the decorative treatment should be sealed to prevent such leakage."
The sealing material should be capable of remaining in place despite any relative movement between the decorative treatment and the fireplace recess.
Responsibility for achieving compliance with the requirements of Part J rests with the person carrying out the work.
"That ‘person’ may be, e.g., a specialist firm directly engaged by a private client or it may be a developer or main contractor who has carried out work subject to Part J or engaged a sub-contractor to carry it out."
"In order to document the steps taken to achieve compliance with the requirements, a report should be drawn up showing that materials and components appropriate to the intended application have been used and that flues have passed appropriate tests."
A suggested checklist for such a report is given at Appendix A and guidance on testing is given at Appendix E. Other forms of report may be acceptable.
"Specialist firms should provide the report to the client, developer or main contractor, who may be asked for documentation by the Building Control Body."
"Flues should be checked at completion to show that they are free from obstructions, satisfactorily gas-tight and constructed with materials and components of sizes which suit the intended application."
"Where the building work includes the installation of a combustion appliance, tests should cover fluepipes and [the gas-tightness of] joints between fluepipes and combustion appliance outlets."
"A spillage test to check for compliance with J2 should be carried out with the appliance under fire, as part of the process of commissioning to check for compliance with Part L, and (in relevant cases) as required by the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations."
Hearths should be constructed with materials and components of sizes to suit the intended application and should show the area where combustible materials should not intrude.
"Where a hearth, fireplace (including a flue box), flue or chimney is provided or extended (including cases where a flue is provided as part of the refurbishment work), information essential to the correct application and use of these facilities should be permanently posted in the building."
A way of meeting this requirement would be to provide a notice plate as shown in Diagram 16 conveying the following information:
"the location of the hearth, fireplace (or flue box) or the location of the beginning of the flue;"
the category of the flue and generic types of appliances that can be safely accommodated;
the type and size of the flue (or its liner if it has been relined) and the manufacturer’s name;
the installation date.
"Notice plates should be robust, indelibly marked and securely fixed in an unobtrusive but obvious position within the building such as:"
next to the electricity consumer unit; or
next to the chimney or hearth described; or
next to the water supply stop-cock.
"For chimney products whose performance characteristics have been assessed in accordance with a European Standard (EN) and which are supplied or marked with a designation, the installer may optionally include this designation on the label as shown in Diagram 16."
There should be a permanent means of safe access to appliances for maintenance.
Roof space installations of gas-fired appliances should comply with the requirements of BS 6798:2009.
Fluepipes should have the same diameter or equivalent cross-sectional area as that of the appliance flue outlet and should not be smaller than the size recommended by the appliance manufacturer.
"Flues should be at least the size shown in Table 2 relevant to the particular appliance, and not less than the size of the appliance flue outlet or that recommended by the appliance manufacturer."
"be to adopt the general guidance given in Section 1, beginning at Paragraph 1.2, in conjunction with the guidance below."
Any room or space containing an 2.2 appliance should have a permanent air vent opening of at least the size shown in Table 1.
For appliances designed to burn a range of different solid fuels the air supply should be designed to accommodate burning the fuel that produces the highest heating output.
Some manufacturers may specify even larger areas of permanently open air vents or omit to specify a rated output (for example in the case of a cooker).
"In these cases, manufacturers’ installation instructions should be followed subject to any minimum ventilation provisions of this Approved Document."
"Open appliance, such as an open fire with no throat, e.g. a fire under a canopy as in Diagram 23."
Permanently open air vent(s) with a total equivalent area of at least 50% of the cross sectional area of the flue.
"Open appliance, such as an open fire with a throat as in Diagrams 22 and 29."
Permanently open air vent(s) with a total equivalent area of at least 50% of the throat opening area.
"Other appliance, such as a stove, cooker or boiler, with a flue draught stabiliser."
"Other appliance, such as a stove, cooker or boiler, with no flue draught stabiliser."
Permanently open vents as below:
Permanently open vents as below:
1:2004 or estimated according to paragraph 1.14.
"For simple open fires as depicted in Diagram 29, the requirement can be met with room ventilation areas as follows:"
Example: an appliance with a flue draught stabiliser and a rated output of 7kW would require an equivalent area of: [5 x 300] + [2 x 850] = 3200mm2 4.
It is unlikely that a dwelling constructed prior to 2008 will have an air permeability of less than 5.0m3/(h.m2) at 50 Pa unless extensive measures have been taken to improve air-tightness.
See Appendix F.
"For multi-fuel appliances, the flue should 2.6 be sized to accommodate burning the fuel that requires the largest flue."
125mm diameter This may be reduced to no less than 100mm when permitted by the appliance manufacturer and supported by calculation according to BS EN 13384-1:2002.
This calculation can be applied to an individual installation or manufacturers can provide precalculated designs.
"Closed appliances include cookers, stoves, room heaters and boilers."
"Fuels such as bituminous coal, untreated wood or compressed paper are not smokeless or low-volatiles fuels."
These appliances are known as ‘exempted fireplaces’.
For fireplaces with openings larger than 2.7 500mm x 550mm or fireplaces exposed on two or more sides (such as a fireplace under a canopy or open on both sides of a central chimney breast) a way of showing compliance would be to provide a flue with a cross-sectional area equal to 15 per cent of the total face area of the fireplace opening(s) (see Appendix B).
"However, specialist advice should be sought when proposing to construct flues having an area of:"
more than 15 per cent of the total face area of the fireplace openings; or
"more than 120,000mm² (0.12m²)."
sufficient draught to clear the products of combustion.
"The height necessary for this will depend upon the type of the appliance, the height of the building, the type of flue and the number of bends in it, and an assessment of local wind patterns."
"However, a minimum flue height of 4.5m could be satisfactory if the guidance in Paragraphs 2.10 to 2.12 is adopted."
"As an alternative approach, the calculation procedure within BS EN 13384-1:2005 can be used as the basis for deciding whether a chimney design will provide sufficient draught."
The height of a flue serving an open fire is 2.9 measured vertically from the highest point at which air can enter the fireplace to the level at which the flue discharges into the outside air.
"The highest point of air entry into the fireplace could be the top of the fireplace opening or, for a fire under a canopy, the bottom of the canopy."
The height of a flue serving a closed appliance is measured vertically from the appliance outlet.
"The outlet from a flue should be above the roof of the building in a position where the products of combustion can discharge freely and will not present a fire hazard, whatever the wind conditions."
Flue outlet positions which can meet the requirements in common circumstances are shown in Diagram 17.
"or separations shown may need to be increased in particular cases where wind exposure, surrounding tall buildings, high trees or high ground could have adverse effects on flue draught."
At least 2300mm horizontally from the nearest point on the weather surface and:
at least 1000mm above the highest point of intersection of the chimney and the weather surface; or
at least as high as the ridge.
At least 1000mm above the top of the opening.
At least 600mm above any part of the adjacent building within 2300mm.
"The weather surface is the building external surface, such as its roof, tiles or external walls."
A flat roof has a pitch less than 10°.
"The clearances given for A or B, as appropriate, will also apply."
A vertical flue fixed to an outside wall should be treated as equivalent to an inside flue emerging at the nearest edge of the roof.
"A way of meeting the requirements where flues discharge on or in close proximity to roofs with surfaces which are readily ignitable, such as where roofs are covered in thatch or shingles, would be to increase the clearances to flue outlets to those shown in Diagram 18."
Note: Thatched roofs can sometimes be vulnerable to spontaneous combustion caused by heat transferred from flues building up in thick layers of thatch in contact with the chimney.
To reduce the risk it is recommended that rigid twin-walled insulated metal flue liners be used within a ventilated (top and bottom) masonry chimney void provided they are adequately supported and not in direct contact with the masonry.
#NAME?
Spark arrestors are not generally recommended as they can be difficult to maintain and may increase the risk of flue blockage and flue fires.
Further information and recommendations are contained in Hetas Information Paper 1/007 Chimneys in Thatched Properties.
For connecting fluepipes a way of meeting the requirements would be to follow the general guidance in Paragraphs 1.32 and 1.33.
Connecting fluepipes should be used only to connect appliances to their chimneys.
a chimney through either a wall of the chimney or a floor supporting the chimney.
Connecting fluepipes should also be guarded if they could be at risk of damage or if the burn hazard they present to people is not immediately apparent.
Connecting fluepipes should be located so as to avoid igniting combustible material.
Ways of meeting the requirement include minimising horizontal and sloping runs and:
separation by shielding in accordance with Diagram 19.
"Where a chimney cannot be cleaned through the appliance, a debris collecting space which is accessible for emptying and suitably sized opening(s) for cleaning should be provided at appropriate locations in the chimney."
Masonry chimneys should be built in accordance with Paragraphs 1.27 and 1.28.
Flueblock chimneys should be built in accordance with Paragraphs 1.29 and 1.30.
The minimum chimney thickness and distance to combustibles (xxmm) should be no less than the manufacturer’s product declaration (Gxx) based on testing to BS EN 1858:2008 (concrete flue blocks) or BS EN 1806:2006 (clay/ceramic flueblocks).
Other masonry chimney products should exceed the minimum thickness indicated in Diagram 20.
Combustible material should not be located where it could be ignited by the heat dissipating through the walls of fireplaces or masonry flues.
A way of meeting the requirement would be to follow the guidance in Diagram 21 so that combustible material is at least:
200mm from the inside surface of a flue or fireplace recess; or
at least xxmm from a flue product with designated separation distance (Gxx); or
"40mm from the outer surface of a masonry chimney or fireplace recess unless it is a floorboard, skirting board, dado or picture rail, mantel-shelf or architrave."
Metal fixings in contact with combustible materials should be at least 50mm from the inside surface of a flue.
A way of meeting the requirements would be to comply with Paragraphs 1.42 to 1.46 in Section 1 (but not Paragraph 1.42(b)).
The appropriate designation is given in Table 3.
"Lining or relining flues may be building work and, in any case, such work should be carried out so that the objectives of J2 to J5 are met (see Paragraphs 1.34 and 1.35)."
Existing flues being re-used should be checked as described in Paragraph 1.36.
Ways of meeting the requirements include the use of:
"liners whose performance is at least equal to that corresponding to the designation T400 N2 D3 G, as described in BS EN 1443:2003, such as:"
factory-made flue lining systems manufactured to BS EN 1856-1:2003 or BS EN 1856-2:2004.
a cast in-situ flue relining system where the material and installation procedures are suitable for use with solid fuel burning appliances and meeting the relevant requirements of BS EN 1857:2003 + A1:2008.
other systems which are suitable for use with solid fuel-burning appliances and meeting the criteria in (a).
liners as described in Paragraph 1.27.
"To minimise resistance to the proper working of flues, tapered gathers should be provided in fireplaces for open fires."
Ways of achieving these gathers include:
"using prefabricated gather components built into a fireplace recess, as shown in Diagram 22(a); or"
corbelling of masonry as shown in Diagram 22(b); or
"using a suitable canopy, as shown in Diagram 23; or"
using a prefabricated appliance chamber incorporating a gather.
"Hearths should be constructed of suitably robust materials and to appropriate dimensions such that, in normal use, they prevent combustion appliances setting fire to the building fabric and furnishings, and they limit the risk of people being accidentally burnt."
A way of making provision would be to adopt the guidance in Paragraphs 2.23 to 2.28 and to provide a hearth appropriate to the temperatures the appliance can create around it.
The hearth should be able to accommodate the weight of the appliance and its chimney if the chimney is not independently supported.
Appliances should stand wholly above:
"sheet material or tiles at least 12mm thick, if the appliance is not to stand in an appliance recess and has been tested to an applicable appliance standard to verify that it cannot cause the temperature of the upper surface of the hearth to exceed 100°C; or"
constructional hearths in accordance with the paragraphs below.
Constructional hearths should:
have plan dimensions as shown in Diagram 24; and
combustible floor and/or decorative surface.
"Combustible material should not be placed beneath constructional hearths unless there is an air-space of at least 50mm between the underside of the hearth and the combustible material, or the combustible material is at least 250mm below the top of the hearth (see Diagram 25)."
Fireplaces for open fires need to be constructed such that they adequately protect the building fabric from catching fire.
A way of achieving the requirements would be to build:
fireplace recesses from masonry or concrete as shown in Diagram 28; or
prefabricated factory-made appliance chambers using components that are made of insulating concrete having a density of between 1200 and 1700 kg/m³ and with the minimum thickness as shown in Table 4. Components should be supplied as sets for assembly and jointing in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
An appliance should be located on a hearth so that it is surrounded by a surface free of combustible material as shown in Diagram 26.
"This surface may be part of the surface of the hearth provided in accordance with Paragraph 2.23, or it may be the surface of a superimposed hearth laid wholly or partly upon a constructional hearth."
The boundary of this surface should be visually apparent to provide a warning to the building occupants and to discourage combustible floor finishes such as carpet from being laid too close to the appliance.
A way of achieving this would be to provide a change in level.
Dimensions shown in Diagram 26 may be reduced to manufacturer’s recommendations for appliances with surface temperatures not exceeding 85°C when in normal operation and where there is no risk of spillage of fuel or ash.
Combustible material placed on or beside a constructional hearth should not extend under a superimposed hearth by more than 25mm or to closer than 150mm measured horizontally to the appliance.
Some ways of making these provisions are shown in Diagram 27.
The requirements may also be met by adopting the relevant recommendations in the publications listed below to achieve a level of performance equivalent to that obtained by following the guidance in this Approved Document:
BS EN 15287-1:2007 Chimneys.
"Design, installation and commissioning of chimneys."
Chimneys for non-room-sealed heating appliances; and
BS 8303:1994 Installation of domestic heating and cooking appliances burning solid mineral fuels.
A fireplace recess may require protection from heat if it is to provide a durable setting for certain appliances such as inset open fires.
Suitable protection would be fireplace lining components as shown in Diagram 29 or lining the recess with suitable firebricks.
Walls that are not part of a fireplace recess or a prefabricated appliance chamber but are adjacent to hearths or appliances also need to protect the building from catching fire.
A way of achieving the requirement is shown in Diagram 30.
Thinner material could be used provided it gives the same overall level of protection as the solid non-combustible material.
Clearances shown in Diagram 30 may be reduced to manufacturer’s recommendations for appliances with surface temperatures not exceeding 85°C when in normal operation.
"Where a new or replacement fixed solid fuel appliance is installed in a dwelling, a carbon monoxide alarm should be provided in the room where the appliance is located."
Carbon monoxide alarms should comply with BS EN 50291-1:2018 and be powered by a battery designed to operate for the working life of the alarm.
The alarm should incorporate a warning device to alert users when the working life of the alarm is due to pass.
"Mains-powered BS EN 50291-1:2018 Type A carbon monoxide alarms with fixed wiring (not plug-in types) may be used as an alternative, provided they are fitted with a sensor failure warning device."
Note: Type A carbon monoxide alarms are fitted with an output function for triggering ancillary devices such as remote alarms or specialist alarms for older people and disabled people.
The carbon monoxide alarm should be located in the same room as the appliance:
"on the ceiling at least 300mm from any wall or, if it is located on a wall, as high up as possible (above any doors and windows) but not within 150mm of the ceiling; and"
between 1m and 3m horizontally from the appliance.
Note: Further guidance and recommendations on the installation of carbon monoxide alarms is available in BS EN 50292:2013 and from manufacturers’ instructions.
Provision of a carbon monoxide alarm should not be regarded as a substitute for the correct installation and regular servicing of combustion appliances.
All combustion installations must be accommodated in ways that meet the requirements of the Building Regulations.
"However, gas installations also have to comply with the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations, which require anyone undertaking gas work to be competent."
"Any gas engineering business, whether an employer or self employed, must be a member of a class of persons approved by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)."
"Because of this, the Building Regulations allow that work need not be notified to Building Control Bodies if it solely comprises the installation of a gas appliance and it is to be undertaken by a member of such an approved class of persons."
"The Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations cover the safe installation maintenance and use of gas fittings, appliances and flues."
"The following paragraphs give builders and lay readers an outline of some of the main requirements of the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations, but for further information reference should be made to the Health and Safety Commission’s Approved Code of Practice (see below) or Building Control Bodies."
"The Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations require that (a) gas fittings, appliances and gas storage vessels must be installed only by a person with the required competence and (b) any person having control to any extent of gas work must ensure that the person carrying out that work has the required competence and (c) any gas installation businesses, whether an employer or self-employed, must be a member of a class of persons approved by the HSE; for the time being this means they must be registered with Gas Safe Register."
Skills [http://www.euskills.co.uk/gas]. Persons deemed competent to carry out gas work are those who hold a current certificate of competence in the type of activity to be conducted.
Assessment of competence may be through the S/NVQ qualilification under a nationally accredited certification scheme or under the Approved Code of Practice arrangements.
"The Gas Safety (Installation and Use) 3.4 Regulations control all aspects of the ways combustion systems fired by gas (including natural gas and LPG) are installed, maintained and used, mainly in domestic and commercial premises, and the classes of persons who may undertake gas work."
The Regulations may be amended from time to time and whichever Regulations are currently in force at the time an installation is carried out must be complied with.
The advice given below reflects the present state of the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations following the amendments that came into effect on 31 October 1998.
Approved Code of Practice ‘Safety in the installation and use of gas systems and appliances’.
Important elements of the Regulations include that:
any appliance installed in a room used or intended to be used as a bath or shower room must be of the room-sealed type;
"a gas fire, other gas space heater or gas water heater of more than 14kW (gross) heat input (12.7kW (net) heat input) must not be installed in a room used or intended to be used as sleeping accommodation unless the appliance is room sealed;"
"a gas fire, other space heater or gas water heater of up to 14kW (gross) heat input (12.7kW (net) heat input) must not be installed in a room used or intended to be used as sleeping accommodation unless it is room sealed or equipped with a device designed to shut down the appliance before there is a build-up of a dangerous quantity of the products of combustion in the room concerned;"
"the restrictions in (a)–(c) above also apply in respect of any cupboard or compartment within the rooms concerned, and to any cupboard, compartment or space adjacent to, and with an air vent into, such a room;"
instantaneous water heaters (installed in any room) must be room sealed or have fitted a safety device to shut down the appliance as in (c) above;
"precautions must be taken to ensure that all installation pipework, gas fittings, appliances and flues are installed safely."
"When any gas appliance is installed, checks are required for ensuring compliance with the Regulations, including the effectiveness of the flue, the supply of combustion air, the operating pressure or heat input (or where necessary both), and the operation of the appliance to ensure its safe functioning;"
"any flue must be installed in a safe position and must be adequate, suitable and effective for use with the appliance which it serves;"
"no alteration is allowed to any premises in which a gas fitting or gas storage vessel is fitted which would adversely affect the safety of that fitting or vessel, causing it no longer to comply with the Regulations;"
LPG storage vessels and LPG-fired appliances fitted with automatic ignition devices or pilot lights must not be installed in cellars or basements.
"In dwellings with an air permeability greater than 5.0 m3/hr/m2 (see Appendix F), permanently open air vents may not be necessary for DFE fires with ratings not exceeding 7kW (net) that have a flue gas clearance rate (without spilling) not exceeding 70 m3/hour."
"These appliances include inset live fuel effect (ILFE) fires, radiant convector fires and boilers, in both room-sealed and open-flued variants."
A way of meeting the requirement would be to follow the guidance in Diagram 32.
An example calculation illustrating the use of this guidance is given in Appendix C.
"For some flueless appliances, it may be necessary to provide permanently open air vents and/or make provision for rapid ventilation as recommended in BS 5440-2:2009 or equivalent, to comply with Part F as well as Part J of the Building Regulations."
"Some ways of meeting the requirement when installing flueless cookers (including ovens, grills or hotplates), flueless water heaters and flueless space heaters are given in Diagram 33."
"A room containing a gas point intended for use with a flueless appliance (such as a gas point for a cooker or a gas point for a space or water heater, the gas point not being adjacent to a flue) should have the ventilation provision required for the installation of that appliance (calculated on the basis that an appliance with the largest rating consistent with the table to Diagram 33 could be installed there)."
These appliances fall into the main categories shown in Diagram 31 and the building provisions for accommodating them safely differ for each type.
"Provided it can be shown to be safe, gas 3.7 fires may be installed in fireplaces which have flues designed to serve solid fuel appliances."
Certain types of gas fire may also be installed in fireplaces which have flues designed specifically for gas appliances.
"The Gas Appliances (Safety) Regulations 1995 require that particular combinations of appliance, flue box (where required) and flue must be selected from those stated in the manufacturer’s instructions as having been shown to be safe by a Notified Body."
"Flueless appliances should meet the requirements, including requirement J2."
A way of achieving this would be to follow the guidance on ventilation provisions for flueless appliances beginning at Paragraph 3.15.
A flueless instantaneous water heater should not be installed in a room or space having a volume of less than 5 m³.
"A way of meeting the requirements would be to follow the general guidance given in Section 1, beginning at Paragraph 1.2, in conjunction with the guidance below."
"Any room or space intended to contain a DFE fire should have permanently open air vents as described in (a) or (b) below, unless the installation is in accordance with Paragraph 3.12:"
"for a DFE fire in a fireplace with no throat, such as a fire under a canopy, the air vent should be sized in accordance with Section 2 of this Approved Document, as if the room were intended to contain a solid fuel fire (see Table 1)."
In older dwellings with an air permeability which is more than 5.0m3/h/m2 the first 7kW(net) can be ignored.
The permanent ventilation provisions listed in this table are additional to the openable elements or (for kitchens only) extract ventilation in accordance with Approved Document F.
Divide the area given above in mm2 by 100 to find the corresponding area in cm2.
An internal space here means one which communicates with several other rooms or spaces.
An example would be a hallway or landing.
"For LPG fired space heaters conforming to BS EN 449:2002+A1:2007, follow the guidance in BS 5440-2:2009."
No permanently open vent is needed if the room or space has a door direct to outside.
"Example: for a space heater in a lounge measuring 4m x 4m x 2.4m (= 38.4m3), the appliance rated input should not exceed 38.4 x 0.045 = 1.73kW (net)."
"Example: a hallway containing a space heater with a rated input of 7kW (net) should have a permanently open vent with equivalent area of: 10,000 + 2750 x (7 – 5.4) = 14,400mm2."
No permanent opening required if the room has a door that opens directly to outside.
"Where builders wish to provide (or refurbish) flues for gas appliances but do not intend to supply the appliances, a way of showing compliance would be to size flues in accordance with Table 5."
If an existing flue is to be used it should be 3.18 checked in accordance with Paragraph 1.36.
"For appliances that are CE marked as compliant with the Gas Appliances (Safety) Regulations, flues should be sized in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions."
Connecting fluepipes should be the same size in terms of diameter and/or equivalent cross-sectional area as the appliance flue outlet.
The chimney flue should have at least the same cross-sectional area as that of the appliance flue outlet.
Some ILFE and DFE appliances require a circular flue of at least 125mm diameter.
Flues should be high enough to ensure sufficient draught to safely clear the products of combustion.
"The height necessary for this will depend upon the type of appliance, the building height, the type of flue and the number of bends in it, and a careful assessment of local wind patterns."
"For appliances that are CE marked as compliant with the Gas Appliances (Safety) Regulations, compliance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions will meet the requirements."
"Where an older appliance that is not CE marked is to be installed, a way of showing compliance if it has manufacturer’s installation instructions would be:"
"for decorative fuel effect fires, to follow the guidance in BS 5871-3:2001 2005; or"
"for appliances other than decorative fuel effect fires, to follow the calculation procedures in BS 5440-1:2008."
"Outlets from flues should be so situated externally as to allow the dispersal of products of combustion and, if a balanced flue, the intake of air."
A way of meeting this requirement would be to locate flue outlets as shown in Diagram 34 and Diagram 35.
"Note: The plume of wet flue products from condensing boilers, positioned in accordance with the safety distances set out in Diagram 34, can sometimes be considered a nuisance for neighbouring properties."
"Whilst this nuisance is not considered to be within the scope of building regulations, such installations could be considered as a ‘Statutory Nuisance’ as set out in the Environmental Protection Act."
Care may also need to be taken to locate flue outlets away from parts of the building that may be damaged by frequent wetting.
1500mm if a ridge terminal.
"An opening here means an openable element, such as an openable window, or a fixed opening such as an air vent."
"However, in addition, the outlet should not be nearer than 150mm (fanned draught) or 300mm (natural draught) to an opening into the building fabric formed for the purpose of accommodating a built-in element, such as a window frame."
Boundary as defined in paragraph 0.4 (4).
Smaller separations to the boundary may be acceptable for appliances that have been shown to operate safely with such separations from surfaces adjacent to or opposite the flue outlet.
Should not be used.
This dimension may be reduced to 75mm for appliances of up to 5kW input (net).
N/A means not applicable.
Flue outlets should be protected where flues are at significant risk of blockage.
Guidance on meeting this requirement is given below.
Flues serving natural draught open-flued appliances should be fitted with outlet terminals if the flue diameter is no greater than 170mm.
"1:2003, and conforming to BS EN 13502:2002."
The risk of blockage of flues of more than 170mm diameter should be assessed in the light of local conditions.
"In areas where nests of squirrels or jackdaws are likely, the fitting of a protective cage designed for solid fuel use and having a mesh size no larger than 25mm (but no smaller than 6mm) may be an acceptable provision if the total free area of its outlet openings is at least twice the cross-sectional area of the flue."
A flue outlet should be protected with a guard if persons could come into contact with it or if it could be damaged.
"If a flue outlet is in a vulnerable position, such as where the flue discharges within reach from the ground, or a balcony, veranda or a window, it should be designed to prevent the entry of any matter that could obstruct the flow of flue gases."
Satisfactory provision of chimneys and fluepipes for gas appliances may be achieved by:
or (if the intended appliance is new and of known type):
using factory-made components that achieve a performance at least equal to that corresponding to the designation given in Table 6 for the intended appliance type when tested to an appropriate European chimney standard (BS EN); and
"installing these components in accordance with the guidance in Paragraphs 3.28 to 3.35 and Section 1, as relevant, and in accordance with the appliance manufacturer’s and component manufacturer’s installation instructions."
The designation of chimney products is described in Appendix G. The BS EN for the product will specify its full designation and marking requirements.
These are default designations.
"Where the appliance manufacturer’s installation instructions specify a higher designation, this should be complied with."
Satisfactory components for connecting fluepipes include:
any of the options in Paragraph 1.32; or
sheet metal fluepipes as described in BS EN 1856-2:2004; or
fibre cement pipes as described in BS EN 1857:2003+A1:2008; or
any other material or component that has been certified as suitable for this purpose.
Masonry chimneys should be built in accordance with Paragraphs 1.27 and 1.28 in Section 1.
"Chimneys can be constructed from factory-made flueblock systems primarily designed for solid fuel, as described in Paragraphs 1.29 and 1.30 in Section 1."
"They can also be constructed from factory-made flueblock systems comprising straight blocks, recess units, lintel blocks, offset blocks, transfer blocks and jointing materials complying with:"
BS EN 1858-1:2003 for concrete flueblocks of at least class D2; or
BS EN 1806:2006 for clay/ceramic flueblocks with a performance class of at least FB4 N2.
Flueblock chimneys should be installed with sealed joints in accordance with the flueblock manufacturer’s installation instructions.
"Where bends or offsets are required, these should be formed using matching factory-made components."
Flueblocks which are not intended to be bonded into surrounding masonry should be supported and restrained in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
made metal chimneys should be guarded if they could be at risk of damage or the burn hazard they present to people is not immediately apparent.
Combustible materials in the building fabric should be protected from the heat dissipation from flues so that they are not at risk of catching fire.
A way of meeting the requirement would be to follow the guidance in Table 6.
"Where a fluepipe or chimney penetrates a fire compartment wall or floor, it must not breach the fire separation requirements of Part B. See Approved Document B for more guidance."
"Flues should be at least 25mm from any combustible material (measured from the outer surface of the flue wall, or the outer surface of the inner wall in the case of multi-walled products)."
"Where passing through a combustible wall, floor or roof (other than a compartment wall, floor or roof) this separation can be achieved by a non-combustible sleeve enclosing the fluepipe or chimney with a 25mm air-space to the relevant flue wall."
space could be wholly or partially filled with non-combustible insulating material).
Install in accordance with Paragraph 1.45 of this Approved Document with minimum separation distances according to flue designation.
Provide at least 25mm of masonry between flues and any combustible material.
Provide flueblock walls at least 25mm thick.
"Lining or relining flues may be building work and, in any case, such work should be carried out so that the objectives of requirements J2 to J5 are met (see Paragraphs 1.34 and 1.35)."
Existing flues being re-used should be checked as described in Paragraph 1.36.
"For flue liners serving gas appliances, ways of meeting the requirements include the use of:"
liners as described in Paragraph 1.27;
liners as described in Paragraph 2.20;
flexible stainless steel liners appropriately designated to BS EN 1856-1:2003 (refer to Table 6);
other systems suitable for the purpose.
Flexible metal flue liners should be installed in one complete length without joints within the chimney.
"Other than for sealing at the top and the bottom, the space between the chimney and the liner should be left empty unless this is contrary to the manufacturer’s instructions."
Double-skin flexible flue liners should be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
BS 715 liners should be installed in accordance with BS 5440-1:2008.
"A debris collection space should be provided at the base of a flue unless it is lined, or constructed of flue blocks, or is a factory-made metal chimney with a flue box."
This can be achieved by providing a space having a volume of not less than 12 litres and a depth of at least 250mm below the point where flue gases discharge into the chimney.
"The space should be readily accessible for clearance of debris, for example by removal of the appliance."
"For gas fires of the type illustrated in Diagram 31 (a) and (b), there should be at least 50mm clearance between the end of the appliance flue outlet and any surface."
Provisions for back boilers should adequately protect the fabric of the building from heat.
A way of meeting the requirement would be to stand back boilers on hearths intended for solid fuel appliances.
"Alternatively, unless otherwise stated in the appliance manufacturer’s instructions, a way of meeting the requirements would be to stand back boilers on bases complying with Diagram 36."
Gas-fired appliances should be located where accidental contact is unlikely and surrounded by a non-combustible surface which provides adequate separation from combustible materials.
"For appliances that are CE marked as compliant with the Gas Appliances (Safety) Regulations, a way of meeting the requirement would be to adopt the manufacturer’s instructions."
An alternative approach would be to protect combustible fabric with:
"a shield of non-combustible material, such as insulating board, with a fire-resistant surface; or"
an air space of at least 75mm (see Diagram 39).
Appliances should be placed on hearths unless:
they are to be installed so that every part of any flame or incandescent material will be at least 225mm above the floor; or
the manufacturer’s instructions state that a hearth is not required.
"Where hearths are required, guidance on their minimum plan dimensions is given in Diagrams 37 and 38."
"Hearths should comprise at least a (top) layer of non-combustible, non-friable material not less than 12mm thick."
The edges of hearths should be marked to provide a warning to the building occupants and to discourage combustible floor finishes such as carpet from being laid too close to the appliance.
A way of achieving this would be to provide a change in level.
The requirements may also be met by adopting the relevant recommendations in the publications listed below to achieve an equivalent level of performance to that obtained by following the guidance in this Approved Document:
Specification for installation and maintenance of ventilation for gas appliances.
"BS 5546:2000 Specification for installation of hot water supplies for domestic purposes, using gas-fired appliances of rated input not exceeding 70kW."
BS 5864:2004 Specification for installation in domestic premises of gas-fired ducted-air heaters of rated input not exceeding 60kW.
"BS 5871 Specification for installation of gas fires, convector heaters, fire/back boilers and decorative fuel effect gas appliances, Part 1:2005 Gas fires, convector heaters and fire/back boilers and heating stoves (1st, 2nd and 3rd family gases); Part 2:2005 Inset live fuel effect gas fires of heat input not exceeding 15kW and fire/back boilers (2nd and 3rd family gases); Part 3:2005 Decorative fuel effect gas appliances of heat input not exceeding 20kW (2nd and 3rd family gases)."

BS 6798:2009 Specification for installation of gas-fired boilers of rated input not exceeding 70kW net.
"Where a new or replacement fixed gas burning appliance (excluding gas appliances used solely for cooking) is installed in a dwelling, a carbon monoxide alarm should be provided in the room where the appliance is located."
Carbon monoxide alarms should comply with BS EN 50291-1:2018 and be powered by a battery designed to operate for the working life of the alarm.
The alarm should incorporate a warning device to alert users when the working life of the alarm is due to pass.
"Mains-powered BS EN 50291-1:2018 Type A carbon monoxide alarms with fixed wiring (not plug-in types) may be used as an alternative, provided they are fitted with a sensor failure warning device."
Note: Type A carbon monoxide alarms are fitted with an output function for triggering ancillary devices such as remote alarms or specialist alarms for older people and disabled people.
The carbon monoxide alarm should be located in the same room as the appliance:
"on the ceiling at least 300mm from any wall or, if it is located on a wall, as high up as possible (above any doors and windows) but not within 150mm of the ceiling; and"
between 1m and 3m horizontally from the appliance.
Note: Further guidance and recommendations on the installation of carbon monoxide alarms is available in BS EN 50292:2013 and from manufacturers’ instructions.
Provision of a carbon monoxide alarm should not be regarded as a substitute for the correct installation and regular servicing of combustion appliances.
"This guidance is relevant to combustion 4.1 installations designed to burn oils meeting the specifications for Class C2 (Kerosene) and Class D (Gas oil) given in BS 2869:2006 or equivalent, liquid biofuel conforming to EN 14213:2003 and blends of mineral oil and liquid biofuel."
Open-flued oil-fired appliances should not be installed in rooms such as bathrooms and bedrooms where there is an increased risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.
"Where locating combustion appliances in such rooms cannot be avoided, a way of meeting the requirements would be to provide room-sealed appliances."
"be to adopt the general guidance given in Section 1, starting at Paragraph 1.2, and to provide permanently open air vents as shown in Diagram 40 in rooms or spaces containing appliances."
"An example calculation illustrating the use of this guidance is given in Appendix D. Where manufacturers’ installation instructions require greater areas of permanently open air vents than those shown in Diagram 40, the manufacturers’ advice should be followed."
appliance such that they ensure adequate discharge velocity to prevent flow reversal problems but do not impose excessive flow resistances.
A way of meeting the requirements would be to use:
Flues should be sized to suit the intended a. connecting fluepipes of the same size as the appliance flue outlet; and
flues in chimneys of the same cross-sectional area as the appliance flue outlet.
"When constructing masonry or flueblock chimneys, a way of doing this would be to:"
make the flue the same size as the appliance flue outlet; or
make the flue larger and of a size that would allow the later insertion of a suitable flexible flue liner matching the appliance to be installed.
Larger flues may need to be provided where appliance manufacturers’ installation instructions demand this.
The outlet from a flue should be so situated externally as to ensure: the correct operation of a natural draught flue; the intake of air if a balanced flue; and dispersal of the products of combustion.
A way of meeting the requirement could 4.7 be to follow the guidance in Diagram 41.
The separations given in the Table to Diagram 41 are minimum values that may have to be increased where there is a risk that local factors such as wind patterns could disrupt the operation of the flue or where a natural draught flue would not be tall enough to clear the products of combustion of an open-flued appliance.
For flues in proximity to roof windows the minimum separation distances identified in Diagram 35 should be applied.
"Note: The plume of wet flue products from condensing boilers, positioned in accordance with the safety distances set out in Diagram 41, can sometimes be considered a nuisance for neighbouring properties."
"Whilst this nuisance is not considered to be within the scope of building regulations, such installations could be considered as a ‘Statutory Nuisance’ as set out in the Environmental Protection Act."
"As such, installers may wish to adopt the guidance in Chapter 6 of the Guide to Condensing Boiler Installation Assessment Procedure for Dwellings."
Care may also need to be taken to locate flue outlets away from parts of the building that may be damaged by frequent wetting.
Flue outlets should be protected with terminal guards if persons could come into contact with them or if they could be damaged.
"If a flue outlet is in a vulnerable position, such as where the flue discharges at a point within reach of the ground, balcony, veranda or a window, it should be designed to prevent the entry of any matter that could obstruct the flow."
In older dwellings with an air permeability which is more than 5.0m3/hr/m2 the first 5kW(net) can be ignored.
Terminals should only be positioned on walls where appliances have been approved for such configurations when tested in accordance with BS EN 303-1:1999 or OFTEC standards OFS A100 or OFS A101.
"An opening means an openable element, such as an openable window, or a permanent opening such as a permanently open air vent."
"Notwithstanding the dimensions above, a terminal should be at least 300mm from combustible material, e.g. a window frame."
A way of providing protection of combustible material would be to fit a heat shield at least 750mm wide.
"Where a terminal is used with a vaporising burner, the terminal should be at least 2300mm horizontally from the roof."
"Outlets for vertical balanced flues in locations M, N and O should be in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions."
fluepipes depends upon the flue gas temperature to be expected in normal service and separate guidance is given in this Approved Document according to whether the proposed installation will have a flue gas temperature more than or less than 250°C as measured by a suitable method such as those in OFTEC Standards A100 or A101.
Suitable chimney systems may then be selected based on their performance designation having been tested in accordance with the relevant European standard.
Flue gas temperatures depend upon appliance types and the age of their design.
"Modern boilers bearing the CE mark, indicating compliance with the Boiler (Efficiency) Regulations (1993), normally have flue gas temperatures not exceeding 250°C."
Condensing oil-fired appliances will normally produce flue gas temperatures well below 100°C.
"Information for individual appliances should be sought from the manufacturer’s installation instructions, from the manufacturers themselves or from OFTEC."
"Where this is not available, flues should be constructed for an assumed flue gas temperature greater than 250°C."
A way of making satisfactory provision for oil appliances in these cases would be to follow the guidance given in Sections 1 and 2 for connecting fluepipes and masonry or flueblock chimneys or to provide a factory-made metal chimney in accordance with Paragraphs 1.42 to 1.46 in Section 1 (but not Paragraph 1.42(b)).
"However, other products may be acceptable if they have been certified for this purpose."
Satisfactory provision of chimneys and fluepipes for oil appliances in these cases may be achieved by:
following the guidance on the selection of components and the manner of their installation as given in Paragraphs 4.13 to 4.20 and the references to Section 1 or (if the intended appliance is new and of known type);
using factory-made components that achieve a performance at least equal to that corresponding to the designation given in Table 8 (for the intended appliance type) when tested to an appropriate European chimney standard (BS EN); and
"installing these components in accordance with the guidance in Paragraphs 4.13 to 4.20 and Section 1, as relevant, and in accordance with the appliance manufacturer’s and component manufacturer’s installation instructions."
The designation of chimney products is described in Appendix G. The BS EN for the product will specify its full designation and marking requirements.
These are default designations.
"Where the appliance manufacturer’s installation instructions specify a higher designation, this should be complied with."
Refer to the appliance manufacturer regarding the suitability of the appliance and flue system for use with oil / bio-liquid blends.
Connecting fluepipes can be constructed using the following components:
any of the options listed in Paragraph 1.32; or
sheet metal fluepipes as described in BS EN 1856-2:2004; or
fibre cement pipes as described in BS EN 1857:2003+A1:2008; or
any other component that has been certified as suitable for this purpose.
Masonry chimneys can be built in accordance with Paragraphs 1.27 and 1.28 in Section 1.
"Chimneys can be constructed from factory-made flueblock systems primarily designed for solid fuel, as described in Paragraphs 1.29 and 1.30 in Section 1."
"They can also be constructed from factory-made flueblock systems comprising straight blocks, recess units, lintel blocks, offset blocks, transfer blocks and jointing materials complying with:"
BS EN 1858:2003 for concrete flueblocks; or
"BS EN 1806:2006 for clay/ceramic flueblocks, with a performance at least equal to the designation given in Table 8 for the intended appliance type."
Flueblock chimneys should be installed with sealed joints in accordance with the flueblock manufacturer’s installation instructions.
"Where bends or offsets are required, these should be formed using matching factory-made components."
Flueblocks which are not intended to be bonded into surrounding masonry should be supported and restrained in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
Chimneys for oil-fired appliances can be constructed using the systems described in Paragraphs 1.42 to 1.46 in Section 1.
"A way of protecting the building fabric from the heat dissipation from flues, where flue gas temperatures are not expected to exceed 250°C, would be to follow the guidance in Table 9."
"Where a fluepipe or chimney penetrates a fire compartment wall or floor, it must not breach the fire separation requirements of Part B. See Approved Document B for more guidance."
Fluepipes and factory-made chimneys should also be guarded if they could be at risk of damage or if they present a hazard to people that is not immediately apparent such as when they traverse intermediate floors out of sight of the appliance.
"Flues should be at least 25mm from any combustible material (measured from the outer surface of the flue wall, or the outer surface of the inner wall in the case of multi-walled products)."
"Where passing through a combustible wall, floor or roof (other than a compartment wall floor or roof) this separation can be achieved by a non-combustible sleeve enclosing the fluepipe or chimney with a 25mm air-space to the relevant flue wall."
Install in accordance with Paragraph 1.45 of this Approved Document with minimum separation distances according to flue designation.
Provide at least 25mm of masonry between flues and any combustible material.
Provide flueblock walls at least 25mm thick.
Flue assemblies for room-sealed appliances a) flues passing through combustible walls should be surrounded by insulating material at least 50mm thick.
provide a clearance of at least 50mm from the edge of the flue outlet to any combustible wall cladding.
"Lining or relining flues may be building work and, in any case, such work should be carried out so that the objectives of requirements J2 to J5 are met (see Paragraphs 1.34 and 1.35)."
"For flue liners serving oil appliances, ways of meeting the requirements include the use of:"
linings suitable for use if the flue gas temperature can be expected to exceed 250°C such as:
liners as described in Paragraph 1.27;
liners as described in Paragraph 2.20;
flexible stainless steel liners designated in accordance with BS EN 1858:2008;
other systems which have been certified as suitable for this purpose.
between the material and the top of the hearth (see Diagram 25 in Section 2).
"To provide a region around the appliance which is free of any combustible material, the appliance should not be placed closer to the edges of the hearth nor closer to any combustible material which is laid over the hearth than the distances shown in Diagram 42."
The perimeter of this safe region should be marked to provide a warning to the building occupants and to discourage combustible floor finishes such as carpet from being laid too close to the appliance.
A way of achieving this would be to provide a change in level.
Combustible materials adjacent to oil-fired appliances may need protection from the effects of heat.
"Special measures may be unnecessary if the materials will not be subjected to temperatures in excess of 100°C, but otherwise a way of meeting the requirement would be to protect combustible fabric with:"
"a shield of non-combustible material, such as insulating board with fire-resistant surface; or"
an air-space of at least 75mm (see Diagram 39 in Section 3).
Appliances having surface temperatures during normal operation of no more than 100°C would not normally require shielding.
1:1997 Code of practice for oil firing.
Installations up to 45kW output capacity for space heating and hot water supply purposes.
linings suitable for use if the flue gas temperature is unlikely to exceed 250°C such as:
any of the linings described in (a) above;
other systems which have been certified as suitable for this purpose;
(if the appliance is new and of known type) flue lining systems that have a performance at least equal to that corresponding to the designation given in Table 8 for the intended appliance type.
Flexible metal flue liners should be installed in one complete length without joints within the chimney.
"Other than for sealing at the top and the bottom, the space between the chimney and the liner should be left empty unless this is contrary to the manufacturer’s instructions."
Double-skin flexible flue liners should be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
Liners should be installed in accordance with BS EN 15827-1:2007.
"Flues which may be expected to serve appliances burning Class D oil should be made of materials which are resistant to acids of sulphur, i.e. minimum flue designation ‘D2’ for non-condensing appliances or ‘W2’ for condensing appliances, according to the designation system in BS EN 1443:2003 and related flue standards."
"Hearths are needed to prevent the building catching fire and, whilst it is not a health and safety provision, it is customary to top them with a tray for collecting spilled fuel."
combustible material such as a steel tray.
This may be provided as an integral part of the appliance.
"If the appliance could cause the temperature 4.26 of the floor below it to exceed 100°C, a more substantial hearth is required."
A way of meeting the requirement would be to provide a hearth of solid non-combustible material at least 125mm thick (which may include the thickness of any non-combustible floor) with plan dimensions not less than those shown in Diagram 24 in Section 2.
Diagram 42 Location of an oil-fired appliance in relation to its hearth.
between 1m and 3m horizontally from the appliance.
Note: Further guidance and recommendations on the installation of carbon monoxide alarms is available in BS EN 50292:2013 and from manufacturers’ instructions.
Provision of a carbon monoxide alarm should not be regarded as a substitute for the correct installation and regular servicing of combustion appliances.
"Where a new or replacement fixed oil burning appliance is installed in a dwelling, a carbon monoxide alarm should be provided in the room where the appliance is located."
Carbon monoxide alarms should comply with BS EN 50291-1:2018 and be powered by a battery designed to operate for the working life of the alarm.
The alarm should incorporate a warning device to alert users when the working life of the alarm is due to pass.
"Mains-powered BS EN 50291-1:2018 Type A carbon monoxide alarms with fixed wiring (not plug-in types) may be used as an alternative, provided they are fitted with a sensor failure warning device."
Note: Type A carbon monoxide alarms are fitted with an output function for triggering ancillary devices such as remote alarms or specialist alarms for older people and disabled people.
The carbon monoxide alarm should be located in the same room as the appliance:
"on the ceiling at least 300mm from any wall or, if it is located on a wall, as high up as possible (above any doors and windows) but not within 150mm of the ceiling; and"
In the Secretary of State’s view requirements J6 and J7 will be met if:
oil and LPG fuel storage installations including the pipework connecting them to the combustion appliances in the buildings they serve are located and constructed so that they are reasonably protected from fires which may occur in buildings or beyond boundaries;
"oil storage tanks, their ancillary equipment and the pipework connecting them to combustion appliances in buildings used wholly or mainly for private dwellings:"
are reasonably resistant to physical damage and corrosion and are designed and installed so as to minimise the risk of oil escaping during the filling or maintenance of the tank; and
incorporate secondary containment when there is a significant risk of pollution; and
are labelled with information on how to respond to a leak.
"Guidance is given in this Approved Document on ways of meeting requirements J6 and J7 when proposing to construct oil storage systems with above-ground or semi-buried tanks of 3500 litres capacity or less, used exclusively for heating oil."
"Heating oils comprise Class C2 oil (kerosene) or Class D oil (gas oil) as specified in BS 2869:1998, liquid biofuel conforming to EN 14213:2003 and blends of mineral oil and liquid biofuel."
"A way of meeting requirements J6 and J7 for such installations would be to follow the relevant recommendations in BS 5410-1:1997, whilst also adopting the guidance in paragraphs 5.4 to 5.12."
"Requirement J7 does not apply to oil storage systems where the capacity of the tank exceeds 3500 litres, or where the tank is fully buried or where the building served is not wholly or mainly used as one or more private dwellings."
"However, requirement J6 applies to oil storage systems serving buildings of all descriptions, where the capacity of the tank exceeds 90 litres, with no upper capacity limit on application, and including cases where the tank is buried."
"For tanks with capacities in excess of 3500 litres, advice on ways of complying with requirements J6 and any other fire precautions legislation may be sought from the Fire Authority."
In England tanks serving buildings which are not wholly or mainly used as private dwellings are likely to be subject to the Control of Pollution (Oil Storage) (England) Regulations 2001 (see paragraph 5.7).
"A way of achieving compliance with requirement J6 would be to adopt the guidance given in Table 10, which also offers advice on reducing the risk of fuel storage system fires igniting buildings and to make provision against the installation becoming overgrown."
"This can be achieved with a hard surface beneath the tank such as concrete, or paving slabs at least 42mm thick, extending out at least 300mm beyond the perimeter of the tank (or its external skin if it is of the integrally bunded type)."
Locate tanks in a place of special fire hazard which should be directly ventilated to outside.
"Without prejudice to the need for compliance with all the requirements in Schedule 1, the need to comply with Part B should particularly be taken into account."
Make building walls imperforate (1) within 1800mm of tanks with at least 30 minutes fire resistance (2) to internal fire and construct eaves within 1800mm of tanks and extending 300mm beyond each side of tanks with at least 30 minutes fire resistance to external fire and with non-combustible cladding; or b) Provide a fire wall (3) between the tank and any part of the building within 1800mm of the tank and construct eaves as in (a) above.
The fire wall should extend at least 300mm higher and wider than the affected parts of the tank.
Provide a fire wall between the tank and the boundary or a boundary wall having at least 30 minutes fire resistance to fire on either side.
The fire wall or the boundary wall should extend at least 300mm higher and wider than the top and sides of the tank.
No further provisions necessary.
Excluding small openings such as air bricks etc.
"Fire resistance in terms of insulation, integrity and stability as determined by testing to the relevant parts of BS 476 or BS EN 1363 or BS EN 1364."
"Fire walls are imperforate non-combustible walls or screens, such as masonry walls or fire-rated composite panel screens."
Fire walls should be built to be stable so as not to pose a danger to people around them.
A way of achieving this when constructing masonry walls would be to follow the guidance on wall thickness in relation to height given in Your garden walls: Better to be safe than sorry (See ’Other Publications referred to’).
"A way of meeting the requirement would 5.6 be to install fuel pipework which is resistant to the effects of fire and to fit a proprietary fire valve system in accordance with the relevant recommendations in BS 5410-1:1997, Sections 8.2 and 8.3."
The Control of Pollution (Oil Storage) (England) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/2954) came into force on 1 March 2002.
"They apply to a wide range of oil storage installations in England, but they do not apply to the storage of oil on any premises used wholly or mainly as one or more private dwellings, if the capacity of the tank is 3500 litres or less."
Advice on the construction of above-ground oil storage tanks that may be subject to these Regulations is contained in Above Ground Oil Storage Tanks: PPG2 (2004).
Note: Below ground oil storage is not recommended where other options are available as underground tanks are difficult to inspect and leaks may not be immediately obvious.
"Some guidance and further sources of reference are contained in installation, decommissioning and removal of underground storage tanks: PPG27(2002)."
Requirement J6 applies to oil storage tanks of 3500 litres or less serving combustion appliances in buildings used wholly or mainly as private dwellings.
"In such cases, secondary containment should be provided where there is a significant risk of oil pollution."
"For the purposes of requirement J6, there is a significant risk of pollution if the oil storage installation:"
has a total capacity of more than 2500 litres; or
is located within 10m of inland freshwaters or coastal waters; or
is located where spillage could run into an open drain or to a loose-fitting manhole cover; or
"is located within 50m of sources of potable water, such as wells, bore-holes or springs; or"
is located where oil spilled from the installation could reach the waters listed above by running across hard ground; or
is located where tank vent pipe outlets cannot be seen from the intended filling point.
is located within Zone 1 (inner protection zone) of an Environment Agency Groundwater Source Protection Zone (SPZ).
agency.gov.uk/research/library/maps.
"Inland freshwaters include streams, rivers, 5.9 reservoirs and lakes, as well as ditches and ground drainage (including perforated drainage pipes) that feed into them."
"When secondary containment is considered necessary, a way of meeting the requirement would be to:"
provide an integrally bunded prefabricated tank; or
"construct a bund from masonry or concrete in accordance with the general guidance in Above Ground Oil Storage Tanks: PPG2 (2004) and the specific advice in Masonry Bunds for Oil Storage Tanks or Concrete Bunds for Oil Storage Tanks, as appropriate."
"where the bund walls are part of the walls of a chamber or building enclosing the tank, any door through such walls should be above bund level; and"
specialist advice should be sought where the bund has a structural role as part of a building.
"Bunds, whether part of prefabricated tank systems or constructed on site, should have a capacity of at least 110 per cent of the largest tank they contain."
Integrally bunded oil tanks that comply with the following standards will meet this provision:
OFS T100 Oil Firing Equipment Standard – Polyethylene Oil Storage Tanks for Distillate Fuels (2008);
"OFS T100 Oil Firing Equipment Standard – Steel Oil Storage Tanks and Tank Bunds for use with Distillate Fuels, Lubrication Oils and Waste Oils (2008)."
An oil storage installation should carry a label in a prominent position giving advice on what to do if an oil spill occurs and the telephone number of the Environment Agency’s Emergency Hotline (see Appendix F).
LPG installations are controlled by legislation enforced by the HSE or their agents.
"Factors which determine the amount of building work necessary for a LPG storage installation to comply include its capacity, whether tanks are installed above or below ground and the nature of the premises they serve."
A fire wall should be at least as high as the pressure relief valve.
It should extend horizontally such that the separation specified in Table 11 (Column B) is maintained:
when measured around the ends of the fire wall as shown in Diagram 43(b); or
"when measured to the ends of the fire wall as shown in Diagram 43(c), if the fire wall is the boundary or part of the building."
"Where an LPG storage installation consists of a set of cylinders, a way of meeting the requirements would be to follow the provisions below and as shown in Diagram 44."
"ventilated position at ground level, where they are readily accessible, reasonably protected from physical damage and where they do not obstruct exit routes from the building."
Satisfactory building work provisions would be to provide a firm level base such as concrete at least 50mm thick or paving slabs bedded on mortar at a location so that cylinder valves will be:
at least 1m horizontally and 300mm vertically from openings in the building or heat sources such as flue terminals and tumble-dryer vents; and
"at least 2m horizontally from drains without traps, unsealed gullies or cellar hatches unless an intervening wall not less than 250mm high is provided."
consultation with the HSE.
"However, for an installation of up to 1.1 tonne capacity, whose tank stands in the open air, following the guidance in this Approved Document and the relevant guidance in Approved Document B, will normally ensure that no further building work is needed to comply with other legislation."
"For LPG storage systems of up to 1.1 tonne capacity, comprising one tank standing in the open air, a way of meeting the requirement J6 would be to comply with the relevant recommendations in the UKLPG Code Of Practice 1: Bulk LPG Storage at Fixed Installations Part 1 (2009) and BS 5482-1:2005 (see Appendix F and ‘Other Publications referred to’) whilst also adopting the following guidance:"
The LPG tank should be installed outdoors and not within an open pit.
"The tank should be adequately separated from buildings, the boundary and any fixed sources of ignition to enable safe dispersal in the event of venting or leaks and in the event of fire to reduce the risk of fire spreading."
"A way of meeting the requirements in normal situations would be to adopt the separation distances in Table 11 and Diagram 43, which also offers advice on reducing the risk of LPG storage fires igniting the building."
"Drains, gullies and cellar hatches within the separation distances should be protected from gas entry."
"Fire walls may be free-standing walls built between the tank and the building, boundary and fixed source of ignition (see Diagram 43 (b)) or a part of the building or a boundary wall belonging to the property."
"Where a fire wall is part of the building or a boundary wall, it should be located in accordance with Diagram 43(c) and, if part of the building, constructed in accordance with Diagram 43(d)."
"Suitable fire walls would be imperforate and of solid masonry, concrete or similar construction."
"They should have a fire resistance (insulation, integrity and stability (REI)) of at least 30 minutes but, if part of the building as shown in Diagram 43 (d), they should have a fire resistance (REI) of at least 60 minutes."
"To ensure good ventilation, fire walls should not normally be built on more than one side of a tank."
Capacity of tank not exceeding (tonnes):
"In respect of installation pipework subject to the provisions of the GSIUR, Regulation 19(6) of the GSIUR requires that installation pipework should not be installed in any shaft, duct or void which is not adequately ventilated."
This is also applicable to LPG pipework in buildings not subject to GSIUR.
Guidance on the ventilation of pipe in ducts can be found in BS 8131:1997 Code of Practice for accommodation of building services in ducts.
"For the puposes of the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998 (GSIUR), where the LPG service pipework runs underground from the LPG tank to the premises it should be manufactured of non-corroding material."
Pipe entering the building should be manufactured from metallic material and the transition joints between the non-metallic and metallic pipe should be located outdoors.
The pipe should enter the building above ground and be sleeved.
The sleeve should be continuous through the external wall and be sealed at the inner wall to ensure that any escapes of gas are vented to the outside only.
Further guidance is available in UKLPG Code of Practice 22 and Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers standard IG/TD/4.

"15kW (net) is installed in an appliance compartment such as a boiler room, which is ventilated directly to the outside."
The design of the boiler is such that it requires cooling air in these circumstances.
"The cooling air is exhausted via vent D, C2 which has an area:"
"Vent E allows the cooling air to enter, as C3 well as admitting the air needed for combustion and the safe operation of the flue."
It has an area:
The ventilation areas in cm² can be found by dividing the results given above in mm² by 100.
"an appliance compartment such as a cupboard, which is ventilated via an adjoining room."
The air permeability of the dwelling is 6.0 m3/(h.m2) at 50Pa.
"The appliance has a rated output of 11kW, i.e. 6kW more than the rating at which permanent ventilation openings become necessary for the adjoining room."

"This Appendix describes ways of checking E1 the compliance with J2 of existing, relined or new flues, and (where included in the work) the combustion appliance."
It applies only to natural draught flues intended for open-flued appliances.
"The procedures described are used only to assess whether the flue in the chimney, the connecting fluepipe (and flue gas passages in the appliance) are free of obstruction and acceptably gas-tight."
"In addition, appliance performance tests, including flue spillage tests to check for compliance with J2, should be carried out when an appliance is commissioned to check for compliance with Part L and as required by the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations."
"Modifications made whilst the flue was out of service, such as the fitting of a ventilator terminal, which would be incompatible with using the flue with the intended appliance;"
Correct lining and lining sizes for the proposed new application.
Perform checks where necessary to demonstrate that the flue is free from restriction: a visual check may be sufficient where the full length of the flue can be seen.
"In cases of doubt, a way of checking this would be to carry out a coring ball test."
Check the gas-tightness of the flue by carrying out a smoke test.
Tests on flues should be carried out at the most appropriate time during the building work.
"Where possible, for example, smoke tests should be performed when the structure of a chimney is visible and before the application of finishes such as plaster or dry lining that could obscure sight of smoke leakage during testing."
"Flues in existing chimneys can be obstructed by nests, debris resulting from deterioration of the structure (e.g. brickwork, flue lining material or pieces of chimney pot) and by soot and tar."
"Flues in existing chimneys may also leak as a result of holes or cracks appearing in the structure and linings, particularly at joints."
"The top, exposed part of a chimney is particularly prone to decay."
A way of checking the state of a flue prior to bringing it back into use would be to do the following:
Sweep the flue.
This is intended to clean the flue to demonstrate that it is essentially free from obstructions and to enable better visual inspection and testing of the flue.
Tar deposits caused by burning wood may be especially hard to dislodge and should be removed.
The debris that comes down the chimney when sweeping should be examined for excessive quantities of lining or brick that are signs that further repairs are necessary.
Carry out a visual inspection of the accessible parts to identify:
"Deterioration in the structure, connections or linings which could affect the flue’s gas-tightness and safe performance with the proposed combustion appliance."
Examine the interior of the flue and the exterior of the chimney including in the roof-space.
breast is a sign of leaks that possibly indicate damage;
"installed the right way up, with sockets facing upwards and joints are sealed so that moisture and condensate will be contained in the chimney."
"Check during construction that liners are Flues in new masonry chimneys can be E5 obstructed, particularly at bends, by debris left during construction or by excess mortar falling into the flue or by jointing material extruded from between liners and flueblocks."
The flues should be checked to demonstrate that they have been correctly constructed and are free of restrictions and acceptably gas-tight.
A way of checking the condition of a new flue prior to bringing it into use would be to do the following:
"Carry out a visual inspection of the accessible parts to check that the lining, liners or flueblocks are of the correct materials and of suitable size for the proposed application."
Perform checks where necessary to demonstrate that the flue is free from restriction: a visual check may be sufficient where the full length of the flue can be seen.
"In cases of doubt, a way of checking this would be to carry out a coring ball test or to sweep the flue, which may be more effective at removing flexible debris that might not be dislodged by a coring ball."
Check the operation and gas-tightness of the flue by carrying out a smoke test.
A checklist for the visual inspection of a newly completed factory-made metal chimney is given in BS EN 15287-1:2007 and additional checks or particular variants may be included in manufacturers’ installation instructions.
"Following inspection, the chimney should be subjected to a smoke test."
"checked to show that it is free from restrictions, such as from surplus material (where that can occur) and that it is acceptably gas-tight by using the same tests as would be applied in the case of a newly built flue."
"However, a flue which has been relined with a flexible metal liner in accordance with Paragraph 3.36 of this Approved Document may be assumed to be unobstructed and acceptably gas-tight."
"Where a combustion appliance is provided and connected up to the flue system as part of the work, the complete system of appliance and flue should be tested for gas-tightness in addition to testing the flue separately as above."
"For gas appliances, an appropriate spillage test procedure is given in BS 5440-1:2008."
"For oil- and solid-fuel fired appliances, suitable test procedures are given in BS 5410-1:1997 and BS EN 15287-1:2007 Annex O respectively."
This test may be appropriate for proving E9 the minimum diameter of circular flues.
It may also be used to check for obstructions in square flues but will not detect obstructions in the corners.
It is not applicable to fluepipes and should not be used with flexible metal flue liners.
It should be carried out before smoke testing.
"A heavy ball, with a diameter about 25mm less than that of the flue, is lowered on a rope from the flue outlet to the bottom of the flue."
"If an obstruction is encountered, the blockage should be removed and the test repeated."
"Where an existing flue is to be checked with a smoke test, it should first be swept."
Two smoke testing procedures are described below.
tightness of the whole flue and may be used for one serving a solid fuel appliance or if there is any doubt over the condition of a gas or oil flue.
Test II may be used where the flue is to serve a gas-fired appliance.
Neither test is a substitute for any spillage or flue draught interference test required when commissioning the appliance.
All doors and windows in the room served by the flue should be closed.
"The flue should first be warmed to establish a draught, e.g. with a blow lamp or electric heater."
"A suitable number of flue testing smoke pellets are placed at the base of the flue, such as in the fireplace recess or in the appliance if it is fitted, and ignited."
"When smoke starts to form, the base of the flue or fireplace opening should be sealed or the appliance should be closed, so that the smoke can only enter the flue."
Smoke should be seen to issue freely from the flue outlet or terminal.
"When this is established, the top of the flue is sealed."
"The full length of the flue should then be checked, bearing in mind Paragraph E19; there should be no significant leakage."
The test should be allowed to continue for at least 5 minutes.
The closures at the top and bottom of the flue should then be removed.
All doors and windows in the room served by the flue should be closed.
The flue should first be warmed to establish a draught.
"A suitable flue-testing smoke pellet is ignited at the base of the flue or in the intended position of the appliance, so that the smoke is drawn into the flue with the rising draught."
Smoke should be seen to issue freely from the flue outlet or terminal and not to spill back into the room.
There should be no significant leakage of smoke from the length of the chimney inside or outside of the building.
Smoke tests I and II are in line with the recommendations in BS 5440-1:2008.
"Where warming of the flue is specified, this is intended to establish a draught, but this may take more than 10 minutes in the case of large or cold flues."
"Appliances, where fitted, should not be under fire at the time of carrying out the test."
"During a smoke test, smoke should not emerge from the outlet of any other flue, as this indicates leakage between flues."
"When checking for smoke leakage from a flue, it should be borne in mind that smoke from a faulty flue can emerge some distance away from the original fault."
"In such cases, the smoke could emerge from such places as barge overhangs in the end of terrace dwellings or from window reveals in cavity walls."
"Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems Approved Document JONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION APPENDIX E E20 The purpose of carrying out smoke testing is to check that flue gases will rise freely through the flue and to identify whether there are any faults, such as incorrectly sealed joints or damage that would cause the flue gases to escape into the dwelling."
It should be noted that smoke pellets E21 create a pressure significantly higher than the pressure required in the product standards for natural draught chimneys and for flues having a gas-tightness designation of N1.
Flues to this designation are permitted to have a leakage rate of up to 2 litre/s/m² flue wall area.
Some smoke leakage may therefore be seen during smoke tests and it can be a matter of expert judgement of whether leakage indicates failure.
"However, wisps of smoke visible on the outside of the chimney or near joints between chimney sections do not necessarily indicate a fault."
"If forceful plumes, or large volumes of smoke are seen, this could indicate a major fault such as an incorrectly made connection or joint, or a damaged section of chimney that requires investigation and remedial action followed by a repeat of the test."
Failure to implement even a few of these F3 measures will typically mean that the overall air permeability will probably exceed 5.0 m3/(h.m2) at 50 Pa.
"However, individual rooms in some older houses with solid walls and solid floors can be inherently air-tight when fitted with modern glazing."
The situation may therefore need to be assessed with respect both to the overall dwelling and to the individual room where the appliance is to be fitted.
at 50 Pa and fit the appropriate permanent ventilation or seek specialist advice.
Improving airtightness in dwellings.
"The minimum requirements for permanent F1 ventilation for certain appliances depend on a knowledge of the air-tightness of the dwelling where they are to be installed, Dwellings built after 2008 are likely to have evidence of the air-tightness either through an individual air permeability test certificate or through representative testing of the same design of dwelling on the same housing development."
Older houses are unlikely to have been F2 tested but are unlikely to achieve an air permeability of less than 5.0 m3/(h.m2) at 50 Pa unless the building fabric has been substantially upgraded.
That would include all or most of the following measures:
• All cable entry for lighting and ceiling roses sealed.
Recessed lighting should not penetrate ceilings separating loft spaces.
J Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems Approved Document JONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Appendix G: European chimney designations This informative appendix provides a G1 summary of the European chimney designation scheme.
"The essence of the scheme is a series of code letters based on the general chimney designation scheme of BS EN 1443:2003, an example of which and their explanation is given below."
The designation of a chimney consists of :
"European chimney standards have been G3 developed based on the material of the flue liner e.g. clay/ceramic, concrete, metal, and plastic."
"Some material based standards have adopted a different shortened designation e.g. for clay flue liners a designation Liner – EN 1457-300-A1-N2 means it is suitable for a chimney with the designation T600 N2 D 3 G, with a nominal size of 300mm."
The designation of the corrosion G4 resistance class of a metal chimney product is dealt with in BS EN 1856-1 and BS EN 1856-2 by a two-fold approach.
"A minimum material specification and thickness is allowed which is dependent on that which is permitted in member states regulations, where these exist."
Products upon which a declaration has been made in this manner are designated Vm.
The alternative approach involves the choice of one of three corrosion resistance tests.
"Products meeting the tests carry the designation V1, V2 or V3, as appropriate allow the product to be designated with the Corrosion resistance class 1, 2, or 3 respectively."
"The material specification still forms part of the overall designation, and appears alongside the ‘V’ letter, e.g. Vx-L40045."
The material specification for the liner (or connecting pipe) is formed by the letter ‘L’ followed by five digits.
The first two digits represent the material type and the last three digits represent the material thickness in multiples of 0.01mm.
"For the UK, guidance on the minimum G5 material specification appropriate for the various applications in terms of corrosion resistance (solid fuel, gas and oil) is given in the UK National Annex to BS EN 1856-1 and -2."
For further examples of shortened designation refer to the specific product standards.
"In selecting an appliance for a given G6 chimney designation, the appliance, irrespective of the fuel used, is required to generate combustion products with characteristics equal or less than those designated for the chimney."
"When selecting a chimney suitable for a given appliance, any chimney with performance characteristics equal to or higher than those appropriate for the appliance may be used."
rated output test (usually the maximum operating level);
"Pressure classes are set out in Table G2 G8 and expressed as either ‘N’, ‘P’ or ‘H’ followed by either ‘1’ or ‘2’."
N relates in general to natural draught chimneys i.e. operating under negative pressure where the value 1 or 2 allows for a different class of product; metal chimneys to BS EN 1856-1 have the class N1.
In the UK the value N2 will be assigned as a minimum to masonry chimneys.
P and H relate to chimneys which operate under positive pressure e.g. for fan assisted applications and diesel generators respectively.
"The pressure designation depends on the gas tightness it achieves, the lower number being the more onerous, the higher allowed leakage for positive pressure application being intended to external installations."
"Sootfire resistance class – expressed as either ‘G’ with sootfire resistance, or ‘O’ without, A product assigned the designation ‘G’ has been tested at 1000ºC for 30 minutes."
The designation of the minimum distance from the outer surface of the chimney to combustible material is given as xx expressed in millimetres (e.g. the distance ‘x-x’ identified in paragraph 1.45 and diagram 13).
Condensate resistance class – expressed as either ‘W’ for wet or ‘D’ for dry operations.
"A product designated ‘W’, able to contain condensates within the flue, is aimed at condensing appliances."
A product designated ‘D’ would usually have flue gas temperatures high enough to avoid condensate formation.
"Corrosion resistance classes are set out in Table G3 – this is fuel dependant and expressed as 1, 2 or 3."

The following is a high level summary of the Building Regulations relevant to most types of building work.
"Where there is any doubt you should consult the full text of the regulations, available at www.legislation.gov.uk."
Regulation 3 of the Building Regulations defines ‘building work’.
Building work includes:
the material alteration of a building or a controlled service or fitting.
"Regulation 4 states that building work should be carried out in such a way that, when work is complete:"
for work on an existing building that did not comply with the applicable requirements of the Building Regulations:
the building must be no more unsatisfactory in relation to the requirements than before the work was carried out.
Regulation 5 defines a ‘material change of use’ in which a building or part of a building that was previously used for one purpose will be used for another.
The Building Regulations set out requirements that must be met before a building can be used for a new purpose.
"To meet the requirements, the building may need to be upgraded in some way."
"In accordance with regulation 7, building work must be carried out in a workmanlike manner using adequate and proper materials."
Guidance on materials and workmanship is given in Approved Document 7.
Part 6 of the Building Regulations imposes additional specific requirements for energy efficiency.
"If a building is extended or renovated, the energy efficiency of the existing building or part of it may need to be upgraded."
Most building work and material changes of use must be notified to a building control body unless one of the following applies.
It is work that will be self-certified by a registered competent person or certified by a registered third party.
"It is work exempted from the need to notify by regulation 12(6A) of, or Schedule 4 to, the Building Regulations."
"People who are responsible for building work (e.g. agent, designer, builder or installer) must ensure that the work complies with all applicable requirements of the Building Regulations."
The building owner may also be responsible for ensuring that work complies with the Building Regulations.
"If building work does not comply with the Building Regulations, the building owner may be served with an enforcement notice."

Protection from collision with open windows etc. Performance Section 6: Protection from collision with open windows etc. Projecting parts Spaces used only for maintenance Requirement K5.2:
"This approved document gives guidance on how to comply with Parts K1, K2, K3, K4, K5.1, K5.2, K5.3, K5.4 and K6 of the Building Regulations."
It contains the following sections:
Section 5: Section 6: Guidance on protection from collision with open windows etc.
Section 7: Section 8: Guidance on safe opening and closing of windows etc.
Section 9: Guidance on safe access for cleaning windows etc.
Section 10: Guidance on protection against impact from and trapping by doors.
Regulation 3 defines building work such that the following applies.
"erection, extension or material alteration of a building (other than an exempt building), and"
requirement K4 and K5.2.
"work, but the supply of the glazing may be subject to consumer protection legislation."
Requirement K1 applies to means of access outside a building only when the access is part of the building (i.e. attached).
"For example, requirement K1 does not apply to steps on land leading to a building, but does apply to entrance steps which are part of the building."
Regarding access routes.
Buildings other than dwellinghouses.
The guidance provided in this document is in relation to the permanent features which form part of the building providing reasonable safety in the appropriate circumstances.
"However, there may well be particular situations, such as access for maintenance required less frequently than once a month (e.g. see paragraph 1.42b), where such permanent features may be less appropriate."
"this may be the case the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 provides detail on procedures for safe use of temporary means of access, together with focus on effective planning and management of risk."
"Health and safety regulations such as the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 may impose requirements on employers and those in control of premises used as workplaces in relation to certain physical characteristics of the workplace."
"Where such regulations apply there may be confusion as to whether the Building Regulations or health and safety requirements take precedence, as both will apply."
"Where an inspector for the purposes of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 has identified a contravention of such health and safety regulations they may seek to serve an improvement notice to secure compliance."
"In such circumstances the inspector is prevented by virtue of section 23(3) of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 from requiring measures which are more onerous than necessary to comply with any requirements of the Building Regulations, unless the specific requirement of health and safety regulations are themselves more onerous."
Where applicable the following cross-referencing should be made.
"For building work relating to requirement K1 of the Building Regulations, regarding the design of stairs, ladders and ramps, see regulation 17 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."
"Regulation 17 relates to permanent stairs, ladders and ramps on pedestrian routes within the workplace premises, including those used to give access for maintenance to parts of the workplace premises."
"For building work relating to requirement K2 of the Building Regulations, regarding the avoidance of risk from falling when working at height, see regulation 6 of the Work at Height Regulations 2005."
"For building work relating to requirement K3 of the Building Regulations, regarding the design of vehicle barriers and loading bays, see regulation 17 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."
"For building work relating to requirement K4 of the Building Regulations, regarding the prevention of personal injury, see regulation 14(1)(a) of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."
"For building work relating to requirement K5.1 of the Building Regulations, regarding the requirements for projecting windows, skylights and ventilators, see regulation 15(2) of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."
"For building work relating to requirement K5.2 of the Building Regulations, regarding the requirements for marking windows, transparent or translucent doors, gates and walls, see regulation 14(1)(b) of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."
"For building work relating to requirement K5.3 of the Building Regulations, regarding the requirements for opening, closing or adjusting windows, skylights and ventilators, see regulation 15(1) of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."
"For building work relating to requirement K5.4 of the Building Regulations, regarding the requirements for cleaning windows and skylights, etc., see regulation 16 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."
"For building work relating to requirement K6 of the Building Regulations, regarding the requirements for doors and gates, see regulation 18 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992."
This approved document deals with the following requirement from Part K of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
"Stairs, ladders and ramps shall be so designed, constructed and installed as to be safe for people moving between different levels in or about the building."
"Requirement K1 applies only to stairs, ladders and ramps which form part of the building."
"In the Secretary of State’s view, you can meet requirement K1 by ensuring that the steepness, rise and going, handrails, headroom, length and width of any stairs, ladders and ramps between levels are appropriate to afford reasonable safety to people gaining access to and moving about buildings."
The standard of provision needed to give an acceptable level of safety for access and use depends on the circumstances.
"The standard of provision may need to be higher in a public building than in a dwelling, because people may not be familiar with the building and there may be more users."
"A lower standard of provision may be acceptable where access is required only for maintenance, because greater care can be expected from the people requiring to gain access."
The guidance provided in this document covers internal and external steps and stairs when they are part of the building.
"Additional guidance is provided in Approved Document M when external stepped access also forms part of the principal entrances and alternative accessible entrances, and when they form part of the access route to the building from the boundary of the site and car parking."
See Approved Document M Section 1 (for buildings other than dwellings) and Section 6 (for dwellings).
Measure the rise and going as shown in Diagram 1.1.
"In a flight of steps, for all steps use the measurements for rise and going given for the three stair categories in Table 1.1 below."
"Use any rise between the minimum and maximum with any going between the minimum and maximum, that complies with the relevant note contained in table 1.1."
[ 1] The maximum pitch for a private stair is 42°.
"2] For dwellings, for external tapered steps and stairs that are part of the building the going of each step should be a minimum of 280mm."
"3] For school buildings, the preferred going is 280mm and rise is 150mm."
The normal relationship between the dimensions of the rise and going is: twice the rise plus the going (2R + G) equals between 550mm and 700mm.
"For existing buildings the dimensional requirements in Table 1.1 should be followed, unless due to dimensional constraints it is not possible."
Any alternative proposal should be agreed with the relevant building control body and included in an access strategy (refer to Approved Document M).
"The guidance provided in this document covers stairs or ramps that form part of the means of access within an assembly building such as a sports stadium, theatre or cinema."
"However, if steps are part of the gangways to areas for spectators, the gangways may need to be at different pitches to maintain sightlines for spectators – this may affect the main stairs."
Apply all of the following guidance.
Ensure that the maximum pitch for gangways to seating areas for spectators is 35°.
Align the ends of all rows of seats/wheelchair spaces so that the width of the gangway remains the same.
Provide transverse gangways to give access from the side to storey exits (vomitory exits) within the body of a seating layout.
Ensure that transverse gangways and radial gangways in auditoria with tiered seating do not cross.
Offset the connections between transverse gangways and radial gangways so that the flow of people to the exits is smooth.
"In stepped tiers, use the following measurements for each step in the gangway:"
"If there are two or more rises to each row of seats, make each step an equal height."
"f In a tier that is uninterrupted by cross-gangways, and where the pitch exceeds 25°, use a maximum number of steps of 40."
"Where an exit is approached from a stepped gangway, place a landing the width of the exit and a minimum of 1100mm deep immediately in front of the exit doors."
"For stepped side gangways, provide a handrail in accordance with paragraphs 1.34 and 1.36."
"In stepped tiers, maintain the same level between the seatway and the nearest step."
"Gangways should not be less than 1100mm wide unless used by not more than 50 persons, in which case gangways should be a minimum of 900mm."
"Have level treads on steps, ensuring that the rise and going of each step are consistent throughout a flight of steps and are in accordance with Table 1.1."
Use risers that are not open.
The benefits of a riser that is not open are as follows.
"It removes the possibility of the front of a foot or a walking aid being caught underneath a tread during ascent, possibly causing a fall."
It avoids the feeling of insecurity people get when looking through open risers on a stair.
"For steps, apply both of the following guidance."
"Make step nosings apparent: use a material that will contrast visually, a minimum of 55mm wide, on both the tread and the riser."
"Avoid, if possible, step nosings that protrude over the tread below."
"If the nosing protrudes, ensure that this is by no more than 25mm (see Diagram 1.2)."
"If the soffit beneath a stair is less than 2m above floor level, protect the area beneath a stair with one of the following."
Guarding and low level cane detection.
A barrier giving the same degree of protection.
Steps may have open risers if they comply with both of the following guidance.
Overlap treads by a minimum of 16mm.
Construct the steps so that a 100mm diameter sphere cannot pass through the open risers.
Provide a stair with steps that comply with all of the following guidance.
"Make step nosings apparent: use a material that will contrast visually, 50mm to 65mm wide on the tread and 30mm to 55mm on the riser."
"Use a suitable tread nosing profile, as shown in Diagram 1.2."
Use risers which are not open.
"On the access between levels, provide the minimum headroom shown in Diagram 1.3."
"Provide all means of escape routes with a minimum clear headroom of 2m, except in doorways."
"Where there is not enough space to achieve the height shown in Diagram 1.3, provide the reduced headroom shown in Diagram 1.4."
"For stairs that form part of means of escape, refer also to Approved Document B: Fire safety, Volume 2 – Buildings other than dwellinghouses."
"For flights of stairs, provide all of the following."
"A minimum stair width between enclosing walls, strings or upstands of 1200mm."
A minimum width between handrails of 1000mm.
"For access for maintenance, see paragraph 1.42."
"In exceptional circumstances where severely sloping plots are involved, a stepped change of level within the entrance storey may be unavoidable."
In those instances ensure that stairs within the entrance storey of a dwelling have flights with a minimum stair width of 900mm.
"Divisions of ﬂights should not be more than 2m wide,"
"If stairs have more than 36 risers in consecutive flights, make a minimum of one change of direction between flights, as shown in Diagram 1.6."
Comply with all of the following.
Do not have single steps.
For flights between landings the maximum number of risers should be:
"stairs for access for maintenance, see paragraph 1.42."
"For means of escape requirements, refer also to Approved Document B: Volume 1 – Dwellinghouses, and Volume 2 – Buildings other than dwellinghouses."
"At the top and bottom of every flight, provide landings the width and length at least as great as the smallest width of the flight (see Diagram 1.6)."
"shown in Diagram 1.7, but only when they are kept shut or locked shut when under normal use."
"Landings should be level, with the following exception."
"A landing at the top or bottom of a flight that is formed by the ground may have a gradient, provided that:"
the surface is paved ground or otherwise made permanently firm.
Provide all of the following.
An unobstructed length a minimum of 1200mm on each landing.
"Doors that do not swing across landings, except where they comply with paragraph 1.21c."
"For access for maintenance, see paragraph 1.42."
"A door may swing across a landing at the bottom of a flight, but only as shown in Diagram 1.8."
"For the rise and going, comply with paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3."
"For the going of tapered treads, use the measurements shown in Diagram 1.9."
"For consecutive tapered treads, use the same going."
"If a stair consists of straight and tapered treads, ensure that the going of the tapered treads is not less than the going of the straight treads."

protect people in or about the building from falling.
protect people in or about the building from falling.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, you can meet requirement K2 if, in order to reduce the risk to the safety of people in and around buildings, you use suitable guarding for the appropriate circumstance."
"Unless otherwise set out elsewhere in this document for particular situations, you can achieve this by the following:"
"in buildings other than dwellings: provide pedestrian guarding that is capable of preventing people from falling more than the height of two risers (or 380mm, if not part of a stair)."
The standard of provision for guarding needed to give an acceptable level of safety depends on the circumstances.
"For example, in a public building the standard of provision may need to be higher than in a dwelling, because people may be less familiar with the building and there may be more users."
"For areas where access is required only for maintenance, greater care can be expected from people and therefore a lower standard of provision may be acceptable."
Provide guarding in all of the following locations:
in vehicle parks.
You do not need to provide guarding in the following locations:
in places such as loading bays where it would obstruct normal use.
Guarding should be provided in accordance with all of the following.
"Ensure that guarding is, as a minimum, the height shown in Diagram 3.1."
"You can use any wall, parapet, balustrade or similar obstruction as guarding."
"Ensure that guarding can resist, as a minimum, the loads given in BS EN 1991-1-1 with its UK National Annex and PD 6688-1-1."
"Where glazing is used in the guarding, refer also to Section 5 in this approved document."
Typical locations for guarding are shown in Diagram 3.2.
"For further guidance on the design of barriers and infill panels, refer to BS 6180."
"In a building that may be used by children under five years of age during normal use, guarding should be constructed in accordance with both of the following."
To prevent children being held fast by the guarding: ensure that a 100mm sphere cannot pass through any openings in the guarding.
To prevent children from readily being able to climb the guarding: avoid horizontal rails.

Where people will use the stairs or ladders to access areas for maintenance they should comply with one of the following.
If access will be required frequently (e.g. a minimum of once per month): follow provisions such as those suggested for dwellings in this Approved Document (see Diagram 3.1).
If access will be required less frequently than once a month: it may be appropriate to use temporary guarding or warning notices.
The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 and the Work at Height Regulations 2005 give provisions for such measures.
Use signs as specified in the Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996.
This approved document deals with the following requirement from Part K of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
"Vehicle ramps and any levels in a building to which vehicles have access, shall be provided with barriers where it is necessary to protect people in or about the building."
"Vehicle loading bays shall be constructed in such a way, or be provided with such features, as may be necessary to protect people in them from collision with vehicles."
"In the Secretary of State’s view, you can meet requirement K3 if, in order to reduce the risk to the safety of people from collision with vehicles in and about buildings, you:"
provide loading bays that have an adequate number of exits or refuges which enable people to avoid being struck or crushed by vehicles.
The standard of provision for guarding needed to give an acceptable level of safety depends on the circumstances.
"For example, in a public building the standard of provision may need to be higher than in a dwelling, because people may be less familiar with the building and there may be more users."
"For areas where access is required only for maintenance, greater care can be expected from people and therefore a lower standard of provision may be acceptable."
"If vehicles have access to a floor, roof or ramp which forms part of a building, provide barriers at any edges which are level with or above the floor or ground or any other route for vehicles (see Diagram 4.1)."
Barriers should be provided in accordance with all of the following.
"You can use any wall, parapet, balustrade or similar obstacle as a barrier."
"Construct barriers to be, as a minimum, the height shown in Diagram 4.2."
Ensure that barriers can resist the loads given in BS EN 1991-1-1 with its UK National Annex and PD 6688-1-1.
Loading bays should be constructed with exit points in accordance with both of the following.
"Provide loading bays with a minimum of one exit point from the lower level, as near the centre of the rear wall as possible."
"For wide loading bays (for three or more vehicles), provide a minimum of two stepped exit points, one on each side, or provide a refuge where people can avoid the path of a vehicle in addition to one stepped exit point (see Diagram 4.3)."
"Where there is a danger of people falling, loading bays should be provided with guarding as per the guidance provided in this approved document."
"If guarding is not practical for the particular circumstances, alternative safeguards should be provided and agreed with the building control body."
This approved document deals with the following requirement from Part K of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
"Glazing, with which people are likely to come into contact whilst moving in or about the building shall:"
"if broken on impact, break in a way which is unlikely to cause injury; or"
resist impact without breaking; or
be shielded or protected from impact.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, you can meet requirement K4 if you adopt, in critical locations, one of the following approaches."
"Measures to limit the risk of cutting and piercing injuries by the use of glazing that is reasonably safe, such that, if breakage did occur, any particles would be relatively harmless."
Use of glazing sufficiently robust to ensure that the risk of breakage is low.
Steps are taken to limit the risk of contact with the glazing.
"Impacts with glazing, particularly glazing in doors and door side panels, and at low level in walls and partitions, can result in cutting and piercing injuries."
"For doors and door side panels, the risk is greatest for glazing between floor and shoulder level when near to door handles and push plates, especially when normal building movement causes doors to stick."
"Hands, wrists and arms are particularly vulnerable."
"An initial impact at between waist and shoulder levels can be followed by a fall through the glazing, resulting in additional injury to the face and body."
"In walls and partitions, away from doors, the risks relate predominantly to glazing at low level."
"At that level, children are especially vulnerable."
Diagram 5.1 shows critical locations in terms of safety.
"In critical locations, comply with one of the following."
"Ensure that glazing, if it breaks, will break safely (see paragraphs 5.3 and 5.4)."
Choose glazing that is one of the following:
in small panes (see paragraphs 5.6 and 5.7).
Permanently protect glazing (see paragraph 5.8).
Safe breakage is defined in BS EN 12600 section 4 and BS 6206 clause 5.3.
"In an impact test, a breakage is safe if it creates one of the following."
"A small clear opening only, with detached particles no larger than the specified maximum size."
"Disintegration, with small detached particles."
Broken glazing in separate pieces that are not sharp or pointed.
A glazing material would be suitable for a critical location if it complies with one of the following.
It satisfies the requirements of Class 3 of BS EN 12600 or Class C of BS 6206.
It is installed in a door or in a door side panel and has a pane width exceeding 900mm and it satisfies the requirements of Class 2 of BS EN 12600 or Class B of BS 6206.
Some glazing materials such as annealed glass gain strength through thickness; others such as polycarbonates or glass blocks are inherently strong.
"The maximum dimensions for annealed glass of different thicknesses for use in large areas forming fronts to shops, showrooms, offices, factories and public buildings with four edges supported are shown in Diagram 5.2 (see also paragraph 7.1)."
"In the context of this approved document, a ‘small pane’ is an isolated pane or one of a number of panes held in glazing bars, traditional leaded lights or copper lights (see Diagram 5.3)."
Small panes should be provided in accordance with all of the following.
"In a small annealed glass pane, use glass with a minimum 6mm nominal thickness except in the situation described in b."
"In traditional leaded or copper lights, when fire resistance is not important, you may use 4mm glass."
Use the dimensions and areas shown in Diagram 5.3.
"Maximum area of single pane not to exceed 0.5m²,"
If glazing in a critical location is protected by a permanent screen then the glazing itself does not need to comply with requirement K4.
The permanent screen should comply with all of the following.
Prevent a sphere of 75mm from coming into contact with the glazing.
"If it protects glazing installed to help prevent people from falling, be difficult to climb (e.g. no horizontal rails)."
Protection from collision with open windows etc.
This approved document deals with the following requirement from Part K of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
Protection from collision with open windows etc.
"1—Provision shall be made to prevent people moving in or about the building from colliding with open windows, skylights or ventilators."
Requirement K5.1 does not apply to dwellings.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, you can meet requirement K5.1 if windows, skylights and ventilators can be left open without danger of people colliding with them."
You can achieve this by one of the following methods.
"Install windows, skylights and ventilators so that projecting parts cannot come into contact with people moving in and around the building."
"Install features which guide people moving in or around the building away from any open window, skylight or ventilator."
"In special cases, such as in spaces where access is required only for maintenance, greater care can be expected from people and therefore a lower standard of provision may be acceptable."
Protection from collision with open windows etc.
Section 6: Protection from collision with open windows etc.
"Where parts of windows, skylights and ventilators project inside or outside a building, indicate this as shown in Diagram 6.1 or Diagram 6.2 (but see also paragraph 6.2)."
"In spaces which are used infrequently and only for maintenance you can, for example, mark the projecting part clearly to make it easy to see."
This approved document deals with the following requirement from Part K of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
"2—Transparent glazing, with which people are likely to come into contact while moving in or about the building, shall incorporate features which make it apparent."
Requirement K5.2 does not apply to dwellings.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, you can meet requirement K5.2 by including, in critical locations, permanent means of indicating the presence of large uninterrupted areas of transparent glazing."
"Critical locations (see paragraph 5.1) include large uninterrupted areas of transparent glazing which form, or are part of, the internal or external walls and doors of shops, showrooms, offices, factories, public or other non-domestic buildings."
"The risk of collision is greatest when two parts of the building, or the building and its immediate surroundings, are at the same level but separated by transparent glazing and people may think they can walk from one part to the other."
People moving in or around a building might not see glazing in critical locations and can collide with it.
To avoid this one of the following should be adopted.
Use permanent manifestation to make glazing apparent (see paragraph 7.4).
"Use alternative indications of glazing, such as mullions, transoms, door framing or large pull or push handles (see Diagram 7.1)."
Provide glass doors and glazed screens (including glazed screens alongside a corridor) with all of the following.
"Manifestation at two levels, as shown in Diagram 7.2."
"Manifestation that will contrast visually with the background seen through the glass, both from inside and outside, in all lighting conditions."
"Manifestation in the form of a logo or sign, a minimum of 150mm high (repeated if on a glazed screen), or a decorative feature such as broken lines or continuous bands, a minimum of 50mm high."
contrast strip at the top and on both sides.
"Where glass doors may be held open, they are protected with guarding to prevent people colliding with the leading edge."
between 850mm to 1000mm and 1400mm to 1600mm above the ﬂoor
"Glazed doors with no frame,"
"Manifestation can take various forms, e.g."

"Section 0: Approved Document M Volume 1: Access to and use of dwellings Summary 0.1 This approved document gives guidance about how to comply with requirements M4(1), M4(2) and M4(3) of the Building Regulations."
It contains the following sections:
"Application 0.2 The recommendations of this volume of this approved document apply to newly erected dwellings, and dwellings undergoing material alteration, only."
They do not apply to the extension of a dwelling.
Requirements M4(2) and M4(3) are ‘optional requirements’ as defined in the Building Regulations.
An optional requirement only applies where a condition that one or more dwellings should meet the relevant optional requirement is imposed on new development as part of the process of granting planning permission.
"Where no condition is imposed, dwellings only need to meet requirements M4(1)."
"Compliance should be assessed against only one of requirements M4(1), M4(2) or M4(3) for any given dwelling."
"Where any part of an approach route, including vertical circulation in the common parts of a block of flats, is shared between dwellings of different categories, Section A of the optional requirement for the highest numbered category of dwelling served will apply to that part of the approach route."
Where a local planning authority sets a planning condition for Category 3 (wheelchair user) housing it can specify which dwellings should be wheelchair accessible by including in the planning permission a condition stating that optional requirement M4(3)(2)(b) applies.
"Where no such condition is applied, optional requirement M4(3)(2)(a) will apply by default requiring that dwellings should be wheelchair adaptable."
The person carrying out building work must inform the building control body where any optional requirements apply.
"If people, such as cleaners and caretakers, are employed to work in the common parts of flats and similar buildings the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations will apply."
"The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations contain some requirements that affect building design."
The main requirements are covered by the Building Regulations.
For further information see www.hse.gov.uk.
"Those who dispose of, let or manage premises are subject to the provisions in Part 4 of the Equality Act 2010."
"The Act protects people who meet the Act’s definition of a disabled person from disability discrimination, harassment and victimisation."
The provisions in Part 4 of the Act do not apply to the erection of new dwellings.
Common areas in mixed use development containing both domestic and non domestic functions should meet the requirements for non-domestic buildings in Approved Document M: Volume 2.
"Where a dwelling is subject to a material alteration, the building should be no less compliant with requirement M4(1) than it was prior to the building work taking place."
"Historic buildings 0.12 Historic buildings include listed buildings, buildings in conservation areas, buildings of architectural merit referred to as a material consideration in a Local Plan, buildings of architectural and historic merit within national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, world heritage sites and vernacular buildings of traditional form and construction."
Requirements for accessibility should be balanced against preserving historic buildings or environments.
"In achieving an appropriate balance it would be appropriate to take into account the advice of the local authority’s conservation and access officers, English Heritage and the views of local access groups."
"Requirements M4(1), M4(2) and M4(3) of Part M set out requirements for stepped and ramped approaches forming part of accessible approach routes in and around dwellings."
Part K sets out requirements for stepped or ramped approaches which form part of a building other than where the requirements of Part M are applicable.
"Where both Part M and Part K apply, requirement M4(1), M4(2) or M4(3) as appropriate of Part M takes precedence."
"In meeting the provisions of Part M by providing a level or ramped approach and level threshold, care must be taken to ensure the moisture resistance and design of the dwelling as a whole also complies with requirements C2 and C4."
This section of the approved document deals with the following requirement from Part M of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
Requirement M4(1) does not apply to:
an extension to a dwelling; or

"The aim is to provide a suitable means of access for people from the entrance point at the boundary of the site, and from any car parking that is provided on the site, to the building."
It is also important that routes between buildings within a complex are also accessible.
"In designing an approach to the building, it should be recognised that changes in level are difficult for many people to negotiate, including wheelchair users, people who need to use walking aids and people with impaired sight."
Access routes that are too narrow can also make it difficult for people to pass each other.
It is important to be aware that 1.3 people’s capabilities vary.
"For example, for some people, a stair is easier to use than a ramp."
"The building should be designed, within the overall constraints of space, so that the difference in level between the entrance storey and the site entry point is minimised."
"It is also important that potential hazards on access routes adjacent to buildings, e.g. open windows, are avoided so that people, particularly children and those with impaired sight or hearing, are not injured."
Note: The publication ‘Inclusive Mobility: A Guide to Best Practice on Access to Pedestrian and Transport Infrastructure’ gives detailed guidance on designing the external environment.
"or, if either of these is not accessible, to any alternative accessible entrances."
"If access is generally required between entrances, or between alternative accessible entrances outside the building, this access should as far as possible be level."
The site level of accessible entrances should be determined accordingly.
"Where a difference in level between the boundary of the site or car parking designated for disabled people and the building is unavoidable due to site constraints, the approach may have a gentle gradient over a long distance (for all or part/s of the approach) or it may incorporate a number of shorter parts at a steeper gradient, with level landings at intervals as rest points."
"Generally, gradients within the approach should be as gentle as possible."
"Where the gradient of the approach, whether over its whole length or in part, is 1:20 or steeper, that part of the approach should be designed as ramped access."
"All access routes to principal, or alternative accessible, entrances should be surfaced so that people are able to travel along them easily, without excessive effort and without the risk of tripping or falling."
"There should be sufficient space for people to approach the building, pass others who are travelling in the opposite direction and carry out all necessary manoeuvres."
A surface width of 1800mm can accommodate any amount of non-vehicular traffic without the need for passing places.
"A surface width of 1200mm may be acceptable on restricted sites, subject to agreement with the building control body."
"It is important to reduce the risks to people, particularly people with impaired sight, when approaching and passing around the perimeter of the building under all lighting conditions."
"A ‘level approach’ (from the boundary of the site and from car parking spaces designated for disabled people to the principal entrance, to a staff entrance or to an alternative accessible entrance) will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:"
"it has a surface width of at least 1.5m, with passing places, free of obstructions to a height of 2.1m;"
"passing places at least 1.8m wide and at least 2m long are provided within sight of each other (the width of the passing place may be included in the width of the level approach), but in any case spaced at a distance no greater than 50m;"
"the gradient along its length is either no steeper than 1:60 along its whole length, or less steep than 1:20 with level landings (see 1.26(k)) introduced for each 500mm rise of the access (where necessary, between landings), in all cases with a cross-fall gradient no steeper than 1:40;"
"its surface is firm, durable and slip resistant, with undulations not exceeding 3mm under a 1m straight edge for formless materials."
Inappropriate materials might be loose sand or gravel;
"where there are different materials along the access route, they have similar frictional characteristics;"
"the difference in level at joints between paving units is no greater than 5mm, with joints filled flush or, if recessed, no deeper than 5mm and no wider than 10mm or, if unfilled, no wider than 5mm;"
the route to the principal entrance (or alternative accessible entrance) is clearly identified and well lit;
"the danger of inadvertently walking into a vehicular access route is minimised by providing a separate pedestrian route and, where there is an uncontrolled crossing point across the vehicular route, this is identified by a buff coloured blister surface (see Diagram 1, and ‘Guidance on the use of Tactile Paving Surfaces’)."
"People who need to travel to buildings by car need to be able to park, have sufficient space to enter and leave their vehicle, on occasions move to the rear of their vehicle, then walk, travel in a wheelchair or with pushchairs or luggage, etc. to the principal entrance, the staff entrance or any alternative accessible entrance of the building."
"The surface of a parking bay designated for disabled people, in particular the area surrounding the bay, should allow the safe transfer of a passenger or driver to a wheelchair and transfer from the parking bay to the access route to the building without undue effort, barriers to wheelchairs or hazards from tripping."
"If people need to obtain tickets for pay and display parking, the ticket dispensing machines should be located in a way that allows a person in a wheelchair, or a person of short stature, to gain access close to the machine and reach the payment and ticket dispensing functions."
"People with mobility impairments who arrive as passengers should be able to alight from a vehicle close to the principal entrance, or alternative accessible entrance, of the building in a way that is convenient for entry into the building."
Note: Guidance is available in BS 8300 on:
the provision of parking bays designated for disabled people in different building types;
ticket dispensing machines;
vehicular control barriers; and
multi-storey car parks.
Car parking and setting down will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
at least one parking bay designated for disabled people is provided on firm and level ground as close as feasible to the principal entrance of the building;
"the dimensions of the designated parking bays are as shown in Diagram 2 (with a 1200mm accessibility zone between, and a 1200mm safety zone on the vehicular side of, the parking bays, and with a dropped kerb when there is a pedestrian route at the other side of the parking bay);"
"the surface of the accessibility zone is firm, durable and slip resistant, with undulations not exceeding 3mm under a 1m straight edge for formless materials."
Inappropriate materials might be loose sand or gravel;
"ticket machines, where necessary for wheelchair users and people of short stature, are adjacent to the designated parking bays for disabled people and have controls between 750mm and 1200mm above the ground and a plinth which does not project in front of the face of the machine in a way that prevents its convenient use;"
a clearly sign-posted setting down point is located on firm and level ground as close as practicable to the principal or alternative accessible entrance with its surface level with the carriageway at that point to allow convenient access to and from the entrance for people with walking difficulties or people using a wheelchair.
"Note: Where there appears to be a conflict between the guidance in Part M and Part K, Part M takes precedence; see the Notes to the Requirements."
"If site constraints necessitate an approach of 1:20 or steeper, an approach incorporating ramped access should be provided."
"Ramps are beneficial for wheelchair users and people pushing prams, pushchairs and bicycles."
"Gradients should be as shallow as practicable, as steep gradients create difficulties for some wheelchair users who lack the strength to propel themselves up a slope or have difficulty in slowing down or stopping when descending."
Ramps are also not necessarily safe and convenient for ambulant disabled people.
"For example, some people who can walk but have restricted mobility find it more difficult to negotiate a ramp than a stair."
"In addition, adverse weather conditions increase the risk of slipping on a ramp."
It is therefore beneficial to have steps as well as a ramp.
"Some people need to be able to stop frequently; for instance to regain strength or breath, or to ease pain."
"Wheelchair users need adequate space to stop on landings, to open and pass through doors without having to reverse into circulation routes or to face the risk of rolling back down slopes."
Some people have a weakness on one side.
This leads to a requirement for support at both sides of ramps.
"If the total rise of a ramped approach is too high, it can be unacceptably tiringfor wheelchair users and some people with walking difficulties, even if a number of rest landings are provided."
Note: Guidance is given in BS 8300 on:
lighting ramped access.
A ramped access will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
either it is readily apparent or the approach to it is clearly sign-posted;
the gradient of a ramp flight and its going between landings are in accordance with Table 1 and Diagram 3;
"no flight has a going greater than 10m, or a rise of more than 500mm;"
Going of a flight Maximum gradient Maximum rise 10m 5m 2m Note:
"1:20 1:15 1:12 500mm 333mm 166mm For goings between 2m and 10m, it is acceptable to interpolate between the maximum gradients, i.e. 1:14 for a 4m going or 1:19 for a 9m going (see Diagram 3)."
"there is an alternative means of access for wheelchair users, e.g. a lift, when the total rise is greater than 2m;"
"it has a surface width between walls, upstands or kerbs of at least 1.5m;"
"the ramp surface is slip resistant, especially when wet, and of a colour that contrasts visually with that of the landings;"
The warning should be placed sufficiently in advance of the hazard to allow time to stop and not be so narrow that it might be missed in a single stride.
the frictional characteristics of the ramp and landing surfaces are similar;
there is a landing at the foot and head of the ramp at least 1.2m long and clear of any door swings or other obstructions;
any intermediate landings are at least 1.5m long and clear of any door swings or other obstructions;
intermediate landings at least 1800mm wide and 1800mm long are provided as passing places when it is not possible for a wheelchair user to see from one end of the ramp to the other or the ramp has three flights or more;
"all landings are level, subject to a maximum gradient of 1:60 along their length and a maximum cross-fall gradient of 1:40;"
there is a handrail on both sides;
"there is a kerb on the open side of any ramp or landing at least 100mm high, which contrasts visually with the ramp or landing in addition to any guarding required under Part K;"
"clearly sign-posted steps are provided, in addition, when the rise of the ramp is greater than 300mm (equivalent to 2 x 150mm steps)."
"Note: Where there appears to be a conflict between the guidance in Part M and Part K, Part M takes precedence; see the Notes to the Requirements."
People with impaired sight risk tripping or losing their balance if there is no warning that steps provide a change in level.
The risk is most hazardous at the head of a flight of steps when a person is descending.
"Materials for treads should not present a slip hazard, especially when the surface is wet."
People should be able to appreciate easily where to place their feet by highlighting nosings and avoiding open rises.
People who wear callipers or who have stiffness in hip or knee joints are particularly at risk of tripping or catching their feet beneath nosings.
People with a weakness on one side or with a sight impairment need the dimensions of the tread to be sufficient for them to be able to place their feet square onto it.
"If the going is towards the upper end of the dimensional range, the flight may rise to a greater height without the need for an intermediate landing, as the tread is sufficiently deep to allow a person to stand and rest at any point within the flight."
It should be noted that excessive rounding of nosings reduces the effective going.
"Many ambulant disabled people find it easier to negotiate a flight of steps than a ramp and, for these people, the presence of handrails for support is essential."
Note: Guidance is given in BS 8300 on:
lighting stepped access; and
slip resistance (Annex C).
A stepped access will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
a level landing is provided at the top and bottom of each flight;
the unobstructed length of each landing is not less than 1200mm;
a ‘corduroy’ hazard warning surface is provided at top and bottom landings of a series of flights to give advance warning of a change in level in accordance with Diagram 4;
"where there is side access onto an intermediate landing, a ‘corduroy’ hazard warning surface 400mm deep is provided either on the intermediate landing 400mm from both upper and lower flights, if there is sufficient space to accommodate the surface outside the line of the side access, or within the side access 400mm from the intermediate landing if there is a continuous handrail opposite the side access;"
no doors swing across landings;
"it has flights whose surface width between enclosing walls, strings or upstands is not less than 1.2m;"
there are no single steps;
the rise of a flight between landings contains no more than 12 risers for a going of less than 350mm and no more than 18 risers for a going of 350mm or greater (see Diagram 5);
all nosings are made apparent by means of a permanently contrasting material 55mm wide on both the tread and the riser;
"the projection of a step nosing over the tread below is avoided but, if necessary, not more than 25mm (see Diagram 6);"
the rise and going of each step is consistent throughout a flight;
"the rise of each step is between 150mm and 170mm, except adjacent to existing buildings where, due to dimensional constraints, the case for a different rise is agreed with the building control body;"
the going of each step is between 280mm and 425mm;
rises are not open;
there is a continuous handrail on each side of a flight and landings;
additional handrails divide the flight into channels not less than 1m wide and not more than 1.8m wide where the overall unobstructed width is more than 1.8m.
"Note: In respect of 1.33(l) and (m), for school buildings, the preferred dimensions are a rise of 150mm, and a going of 280mm."
"People who have physical difficulty in negotiating changes of level need the help of a handrail that can be gripped easily, is comfortable to touch and, preferably, provides good forearm support."
Handrails should be spaced away from the wall and rigidly supported in a way that avoids impeding finger grip.
"Handrails should be set at heights that are convenient for all users of the building and should extend safely beyond the top and bottom of a flight of steps, or a ramp, to give both stability and warning of the presence of a change in level."
"Consideration should be given to the provision of a second handrail on stairs in a wide range of building types, and particularly in schools, for use by children and people of short stature."
Handrailing to external ramped and stepped access will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
"the vertical height to the top of the upper handrail from the pitch line of the surface of a ramp, or a flight of steps, is between 900mm and 1000mm, and from the surface of a landing is between 900 and 1100mm (see Diagram 5);"
"where there is full height structural guarding, the vertical height to the top of a second lower handrail from the pitch line of the surface of a ramp, or a flight of steps, is 600mm, where provided;"
it is continuous across the flights and landings of ramped or stepped access;
"it extends at least 300mm horizontally beyond the top and bottom of a ramped access, or the top and bottom nosing of a flight or flights of steps, while not projecting into an access route;"
"it contrasts visually with the background against which it is seen, without being highly reflective;"
"its surface is slip resistant and not cold to the touch, in areas where resistance to vandalism or low maintenance are key factors, use of metals with relatively low thermal conductivity may be appropriate;"
it terminates in a way that reduces the risk of clothing being caught;
"its profile is either circular with a diameter between 32 and 50mm, or non-circular, 50mm wide and 39 mm deep having rounded edges with a radius a minimum of 15mm (see Diagram 7);"
it protrudes no more than 100mm into the surface width of the ramped or stepped access where this would impinge on the stair width requirement of Part B1;
there is a clearance of between 50 and 75mm between the handrail and any adjacent wall surface;
there is a clearance of at least 50mm between a cranked support and the underside of the handrail;
its inner face is located no more than 50mm beyond the surface width of the ramped or stepped access.
"Features of a building that occasionally obstruct an access route, particularly if they are partially transparent and therefore indistinct, or cause a danger overhead, should not present a hazard to building users."
"Requirement M1 or M2 will be satisfied in relation to hazards on access routes where Approved Document K, sections 6 and 10 are complied with."
"Note: Diagram 8 has been moved to Approved Document K, Section 10, all other numbering remains the same."
"The aim for all new buildings is for the principal entrance or entrances and any main staff entrance, and any lobbies, to be accessible."
"Where it is not possible, e.g. in an existing building, for the principal or main staff entrance or entrances to be accessible, an alternative accessible entrance should be provided."
It is important to reduce the risks to 2.3 people when entering the building.
"Steeply sloping or restricted sites sometimes make it impossible for the principal or main staff entrance to be accessible, in which case an alternative accessible entrance may be necessary."
Accessible entrances should be clearly sign-posted and easily recognisable.
"Any structural elements, for example supports for a canopy, are useful in identifying the entrance, but should not present a hazard."
"The route from the exterior across the threshold should provide weather protection, and not present a barrier for wheelchair users or a trip hazard for other people."
"A level threshold is preferred, especially for doors in frequent use."
"Note: Guidance on sign-posting is given in BS 8300, Inclusive mobility and the Sign design guide."
"immediate environment, e.g. by lighting and/or visual contrast;"
any structural supports at the entrance do not present a hazard for visually impaired people;
"there is a level landing at least 1500 x 1500mm, clear of any door swings, immediately in front of the entrance and of a material that does not impede the movement of wheelchairs;"
"the threshold is level or, if a raised threshold is unavoidable, it has a total height of not more than 15mm, a minimum number of upstands and slopes, with any upstands higher than 5mm chamfered or rounded;"
"any door entry systems are accessible to deaf and hard of hearing people, and people who cannot speak;"
weather protection is provided at manual non-powered entrance doors;
"internal floor surfaces adjacent to the threshold are of materials that do not impede the movement of wheelchairs, e.g. not coir matting, and changes in floor materials do not create a potential trip hazard;"
"where mat wells are provided, the surface of the mat is level with the surface of the adjacent floor finish;"
"where provided as an alternative accessible entrance, an accessible internal route is provided to the spaces served by the principal or main staff entrances."
Accessible entrances will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
"they are clearly sign-posted, incorporating the International Symbol of Access, from the edge of the site and from the principal entrance (if this is not accessible);"
"Doors to the principal, or alternative accessible, entrance should be accessible to all, particularly wheelchair users and people with limited physical dexterity."
Entrance doors should be capable of being held closed when not in use.
"A non-powered manually operated entrance door, fitted with a self-closing device capable of closing the door against wind forces and the resistance of draught seals is unlikely to be openable by many people, particularly those who are wheelchair users or who have limited strength."
"A powered door opening and closing system, either manually controlled or automatically operated by sensors, is the most satisfactory solution for most people."
An automatic sliding door arrangement is particularly beneficial as it avoids the risks associated with automatic swing doors and its use can make it possible to reduce the length of any entrance lobby.
"Once open, all doors to accessible entrances should be wide enough to allow unrestricted passage for a variety of users, including wheelchair users, people carrying luggage, people with assistance dogs, and parents with pushchairs and small children."
"It should be noted that double buggies are wider than wheelchairs and that, where relevant to the building type, this should be borne in mind when determining an appropriate effective clear width for an entrance door."
There may be circumstances in existing buildings where it is not practicable or cost-effective to adopt the preferred effective clear widths for new buildings.
"People should be able to see other people approaching from the opposite direction, thereby allowing sufficient reaction time for both parties to avoid a collision."
Doors to accessible entrances will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
"where required to be self-closing, a power-operated door opening and closing system is used when through calculation and experience it appears that it will not be possible otherwise for a person to open the door using a force not more than 30N at the leading edge from 0° (the door in the closed position) to 30° open, and not more than 22.5N at the leading edge from 30° to 60° of the opening cycle;"
"the effective clear width through a single leaf door, or one leaf of a double leaf door, is in accordance with Table 2, and the rules for measurement are in accordance with Diagram 9;"
"they are installed in accordance with Approved Document K, section 10."
"The effective clear width is the width of the opening measured at right angles to the wall in which the door is situated from the outside of the door stop on the door closing side to any obstruction on the hinge side, whether this be projecting door opening furniture, a weather board, the door or the door stop (see Diagram 9)."
"For specific guidance on the effective clear widths of doors in sports accommodation, refer to ‘’accessible sports facilities’."
prams or are carrying heavy objects.
"A space alongside the leading edge of a door should be provided to enable a wheelchair user to reach and grip the door handle, then open the door without releasing hold on the handle and without the footrest colliding with the return wall."
"Door furniture on manually operated non-powered doors should be easy to operate by people with limited manual dexterity, and be readily apparent against the background of the door."
Manually operated non-powered entrance doors will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
"the opening force at the leading edge of the door is not more than 30N at the leading edge from 0° (the door in the closed position) to 30° open, and not more than 22.5N at the leading edge from 30° to 60° of the opening cycle;"
"there is an unobstructed space of at least 300mm on the pull side of the door between the leading edge of the door and any return wall, unless the door is a powered entrance door (see Diagram 9);"
"where fitted with a latch, the door opening furniture can be operated with one hand using a closed fist, e.g. a lever handle;"
all door opening furniture contrasts visually with the surface of the door and is not cold to the touch.
"Activation (e.g. motion sensors and push buttons), safety features and the time-lapse allowed for entry and exit through powered door systems should be carefully considered to suit the needs of people who cannot react quickly."
needs to move to avoid contact with the door as it opens.
Revolving doors are not considered accessible.
"They create particular difficulties, and risk of injury, for people with assistance dogs, people with visual impairment or mobility problems and for parents with children and/or pushchairs."
"If a revolving door is used, an entrance door complying with 2.17 or 2.21 should be provided immediately adjacent to it and signed to show that it is accessible."
Powered entrance doors will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
"they have a sliding, swinging or folding action controlled:"
"manually by a push pad, card swipe, coded entry or remote control, or"
"automatically by a motion sensor or other proximity sensor, e.g. a contact mat;"
"when installed, automatic sensors are set so that automatically operated doors open early enough, and stay open long enough, to permit safe entry and exit;"
"when they are swing doors that open towards people approaching the doors, visual and audible warnings are provided to warn people of their automatic operation when both opening and shutting;"
they incorporate a safety stop that is activated if the doors begin to close when a person is passing through;
they revert to manual control or fail safe in the open position in the event of a power failure;
"when open, they do not project into any adjacent access route;"
"any manual controls for powered door systems are located between 750mm and 1000mm above floor level, operable with a closed fist and, when on the opening side of the door, are set back 1400mm from the leading edge of the door when fully open and contrast visually with the background against which they are seen."
"People with visual impairment should be in no doubt as to the location of glass doors, especially when they are within a glazed screen."
The choice of a different style of manifestation for the door and the glazed screen can help to differentiate between them.
The presence of the door should be apparent not only when it is shut but also when it is open.
"Where it can be held open, steps should be taken to avoid people being harmed by walking into the door."
"Glass doors and glazed screens will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if they comply with Approved Document K, Section 7."
"door size, the swing of each door, the projection of the door into the lobby and the size of an occupied wheelchair with a companion pushing."
"Where both doors of a lobby are automatic sliding doors, the length can be reduced as no door swings are involved, nor is space required for manual operation."
"Similarly, if ‘reduced swing’ door sets are used, the length can be reduced because the projection of the door into the lobby is reduced."
The aim should be to reduce potential hazards from local obstructions within the lobby and minimise distracting reflections from glazing.
"It is also desirable if rainwater from shoes or the wheels of wheelchairs is not taken into the building where it becomes a potential slip hazard, e.g. by the use of cleaning mats."
Entrance lobbies will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
There are a number of reasons for providing a lobby:
their length with single swing doors is in accordance with Diagram 10;
to provide transitional lighting.
The provision of a lobby may make it possible for an external door to have a self-closing device with a lower power size rating than might otherwise be the case.
"However, even in these circumstances, it may not be possible for the entrance door to meet the opening force criterion of 30N at the leading edge from 0° (the door in the closed position) to 30° open, and not more than 22.5N at the leading edge from 30° to 60° of the opening cycle (see 2.9)."
The lobby should be large enough and of a shape to allow a wheelchair user or a person pushing a pram to move clear of one door before opening the second door.
The lobby should also be capable of accommodating a companion helping a wheelchair user to open doors and guide the wheelchair through.
The minimum length of the lobby is related to the chosen b. their length with double swing doors is at least (DP1 + DP2 + 1570mm);
"their width (excluding any projections into the space) is at least 1200mm (or (DL1 or DL2) + 300mm) whichever is the greater when single leaf doors are used, and at least 1800mm when double leaf doors are used;"
glazing within the lobby does not create distracting reflections;
"floor surface materials within the lobby do not impede the movement of wheelchairs, e.g. not coir matting, and changes in floor materials do not create a potential trip hazard;"
the floor surface helps to remove rainwater from shoes and wheelchairs;
"where mat wells are provided, the surface of the mat is level with the surface of the adjacent floor finish;"
"any columns, ducts and similar full height elements that project into the lobby by more than 100mm are protected by a visually contrasting guard rail."
The objective is for all people to travel vertically and horizontally within buildings conveniently and without discomfort in order to make use of all relevant facilities.
"This objective relates in the main, but not exclusively, to the provision of sufficient space for wheelchair manoeuvre and design features that make it possible for people to travel independently within buildings."
"As the entrance hall is the first point of contact with a building’s activities and resources, the reception area in particular should not only be easily accessible but also convenient to use."
"Where a service building has a reception or sales counter, there should be convenient access to it and part of it should be at a level suitable for a wheelchair user or a seated person."
Any lower section should also be wheelchair-accessible on the reception side.
"Designers should also be aware that glazed screens in front of the reception point, or light sources or reflective wall surfaces, such as glazed screens, located behind the reception point, could compromise the ability of a person with a hearing impairment to lip read or follow sign language."
It should be possible for information 3.5 about the building to be easily obtained from a reception point or gathered from notice boards and signs.
"Note: Guidance on aids to communication is available in BS 8300, and on the use of signs in the Sign design guide."
An entrance hall and reception area will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
any reception point is located away from the principal entrance (while still providing a view of it) where there is a risk that external noise will be a problem;
"any reception point is easily identifiable from the entrance doors or lobby, and the approach to it is direct and free from obstructions;"
the design of the approach to any reception point allows space for wheelchair users to gain access to the reception point;
"the clear manoeuvring space in front of any reception desk or counter is 1200mm deep and 1800mm wide if there is a knee recess at least 500mm deep, or 1400mm deep and 2200mm wide if there is no knee recess;"
"any reception desk or counter is designed to accommodate both standing and seated visitors such that at least one section of the counter is at least 1500mm wide, with its surface no higher than 760mm, and a knee recess, not less than 700mm, above floor level;"
"any reception point is provided with a hearing enhancement system, e.g. an induction loop;"
the floor surface is slip resistant.
"Since doors are potential barriers, their use should be avoided whenever appropriate."
"If doors are required, the use of self-closing devices should be minimised (particularly in parts of buildings used by the general public) since, as described in 2.14, they disadvantage many people who have limited upper body strength, are pushing prams or are carrying heavy objects."
"Where closing devices are needed for fire control, electrically powered hold-open devices or swing-free closing devices should be used as appropriate."
devices whose closing mechanism is only activated in case of emergency.
Low energy powered door systems may be used in locations not subject to frequent use or heavy traffic as the opening and closing action is relatively slow.
"The presence of doors, whether open or closed, should be apparent to visually impaired people through the careful choice of colour and material for the door and its surroundings."
"For example, when a door is open, people with impaired sight should be able to identify the door opening within the wall, as well as the leading edge of the door."
Other design considerations for internal doors are as set out in 2.14 to 2.16 under ‘Manually operated non-powered entrance doors’ and should be referred to for guidance.
Note: Guidance is available in BS 8300 on:
low energy powered door systems.
Internal doors will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
"where needing to be opened manually, the opening force at the leading edge of the door is not more than 30N from 0° (the door in the closed position) to 30° open, and not more than 22.5N from 30° to 60° of the opening cycle;"
"the effective clear width through a single leaf door, or one leaf of a double leaf door, is in accordance with Table 2 and Diagram 9;"
"there is an unobstructed space of at least 300mm on the pull side of the door between the leading edge of the door and any return wall, unless the door has power-controlled opening or it provides access to a standard hotel bedroom;"
"where fitted with a latch, the door opening furniture can be operated with one hand using a closed fist, e.g. a lever handle;"
all door opening furniture contrasts visually with the surface of the door;
the door frames contrast visually with the surrounding wall;
"the surface of the leading edge of any door that is not self-closing, or is likely to be held open, contrasts visually with the other door surfaces and its surroundings;"
"where appropriate in door leaves or side panels wider than 450mm, vision panels towards the leading edge of the door have vertical dimensions which include at least the minimum zone, or zones, of visibility between 500mm and 1500mm from the floor, if necessary interrupted between 800mm and 1150mm above the floor, e.g. to accommodate an intermediate horizontal rail (see Approved Document K, Section 10);"
"when of glass, they are clearly defined with manifestation on the glass that complies with Approved Document K, section 7;"
"when of glass or fully glazed, they are clearly differentiated from any adjacent glazed wall or partition by the provision of a high-contrast strip at the top and on both sides;"
"fire doors, particularly those in corridors, are held open with an electro-magnetic device, but self-close when:"
smoke alarm system;
the power supply fails;
activated by a hand-operated switch;
"fire doors, particularly to individual rooms, are fitted with swing-free devices that close when activated by smoke detectors or the building’s fire alarm system, or when the power supply fails;"
"any low energy powered swing door system is capable of being operated in manual mode, in powered mode or in power-assisted mode."
"Corridors and passageways should be wide enough to allow people with buggies, people carrying cases or people on crutches to pass others on the access route."
"Wheelchair users should also have access to adjacent rooms and spaces, be able to pass other people and, where necessary, turn through 180°."
"Corridors narrower than indicated in this guidance, or localised narrowing (e.g. at archways), might be reasonable in some locations, such as in existing buildings or in some extensions."
"In order to help people with visual impairment to appreciate the size of a space they have entered, or to find their way around, there should be a visual contrast between the wall and the ceiling, and between the wall and the floor."
Such attention to surface finishes should be coupled with good natural and artificial lighting design.
Good acoustic design should be employed to achieve an acoustic environment that is neither too reverberant nor too absorbent so that announcements and conversations can be heard clearly.
"the floor is level or predominantly level (with a gradient no steeper than 1:60), with any section with a gradient of 1:20 or steeper designed as an internal ramp and in accordance with Table 1 and Diagram 3;"
"where a section of the floor has a gradient, in the direction of travel, steeper than 1:60, but less steep than 1:20, it rises no more than 500mm without a level rest area at least 1500mm long (with a gradient no steeper than 1:60);"
"any sloping section extends the full width of the corridor or, if not, the exposed edge is clearly identified by visual contrast and, where necessary, protected by guarding;"
"any door opening towards a corridor, which is a major access route or an escape route, should be recessed so that, when fully open, it does not project into the corridor space, except where the doors are to minor utility facilities, such as small store rooms and locked duct cupboards;"
"accessible toilet projects when open into a corridor that is not a major access route or an escape route, provided the corridor is at least 1800mm wide at that point;"
Corridors and passageways will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
"elements such as columns, radiators and fire hoses do not project into the corridor, or where this is unavoidable, a means of directing people around them, such as a visually contrasting guard rail, is provided;"
"on a major access route or an escape route, the wider leaf of a series of double doors with leaves of unequal width is on the same side of the corridor throughout the length of the corridor;"
floor surface finishes with patterns that could be mistaken for steps or changes of level are avoided;
they have an unobstructed width k. floor finishes are slip resistant;
(excluding any projections into the space) along their length of at least 1200mm;
"where they have an unobstructed width of less than 1800mm, they have passing places at least 1800mm long and with an unobstructed width of at least 1800mm at reasonable intervals, e.g. at corridor junctions, to allow wheelchair users to pass each other;"
"any glazed screens alongside a corridor are clearly defined with manifestation on the glass that complies with Approved Document K, section 7."
impaired people should be clearly visible from the building entrance.
"Additionally, a sign identifying the floor reached should be provided on each landing in a location that can be easily seen from the lifting device and is designed so that it contrasts visually with its surrounding."
"Whatever lifting device is chosen, internal stairs should always be provided as an alternative means of vertical access, and designed to suit ambulant disabled people and those with impaired sight."
"A ramp may also be provided on an internal circulation route to a suitable lifting device, if a change of level is unavoidable."
"For all buildings, a passenger lift is the most suitable form of access for people moving from one storey to another."
"For existing buildings, and in exceptional circumstances for new developments with particular constraints (e.g. a listed building or an infill site in a historic town centre), where a passenger lift cannot be accommodated, a vertical lifting platform (platform lift), although not equivalent to a passenger lift, may be considered as an alternative option to provide access for persons with impaired mobility."
"In exceptional circumstances in an existing building, a wheelchair platform stairlift may be considered, provided its installation does not conflict with requirements for means of escape."
The provision of lifting devices will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
new developments have a passenger lift serving all storeys;
"Note: In respect of 3.14(b), for school buildings, the preferred corridor width dimension is 2700mm where there are lockers within the corridor."
"An internal lobby should allow a wheelchair user, with or without a companion, or a person pushing a pram or buggy to move clear of one door before attempting to open the second door, as indicated in 2.27, under ‘External lobbies’."
Internal lobbies will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
their length with single swing doors is in accordance with Diagram 10;
their length with double swing doors is at least (DP1 + DP2 + 1570mm);
"their width (excluding any projections into the space) is at least 1200mm (or (DL1 or DL2) + 300mm) whichever is the greater when single leaf doors are used, and at least 1800mm when double leaf doors are used;"
glazing within the lobby does not create distracting reflections;
any junctions of floor surface materials at the entrance to the lobby area do not create a potential trip hazard;
"any columns, ducts and similar full height elements that project into the lobby by more than 100mm are protected by a visually contrasting guard rail."
A passenger lift is the most suitable means of vertical access and should be provided wherever possible.
"However, given the space constraints in some buildings, it may not always be possible to install the type and size of passenger lift that would be suitable for use by all, and other options may need to be considered to provide for users with mobility impairments."
"new developments, where due to site constraints a passenger lift cannot be accommodated to provide access to persons with impaired mobility, have a lifting platform, of a type designed for the vertical height to be travelled;"
"existing buildings have a passenger lift serving all storeys or, if a passenger lift cannot reasonably be accommodated to provide access to persons with impaired mobility, they have a lifting platform, of a type designed for the vertical height to be travelled;"
"existing buildings have a wheelchair platform stairlift serving an intermediate level or a single storey, only in exceptional circumstances."
In selecting the appropriate lifting device care should be taken to ensure it is fit for purpose.
"Relevant legislation includes the Lift Regulations 1997 SI 1997/831, the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 SI 1998/2307, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 SI 1998/2306 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 SI 1999/3242."
"The illumination in the passenger lift car, on the lifting platform or on the wheelchair platform stairlift should minimise glare, reflection, confusing shadows or pools of light and dark."
All users including wheelchair users should be able to reach and use the controls that summon and direct the lifting device.
Note: Further guidance is available in BS 8300.
The installation of lifting devices will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
"there is an unobstructed manoeuvring space of 1500mm x 1500mm, or a straight access route 900mm wide, in front of each lifting device;"
the landing call buttons are located between 900mm and 1100mm from the floor of the landing and at least 500mm from any return wall;
"the landing call button symbols, where provided, and lifting device control button symbols are raised to facilitate tactile reading;"
"all call and control buttons contrast visually with the surrounding face plate, and the face plate similarly contrasts with the surface on which it is mounted;"
"the floor of the lifting device should not be of a dark colour and should have frictional qualities similar to, or higher than, the floor of the landing;"
a handrail is provided on at least one wall of the lifting device with its top surface at 900mm (nominal) above the floor and located so that it does not obstruct the controls or the mirror;
a suitable emergency communication system is fitted.
"A wheelchair user needs sufficient space and time to enter and leave a passenger lift, particularly when sharing it with other people."
Lift sizes should therefore be chosen to suit the anticipated density of use of the building and the needs of disabled people.
The minimum size lift car shown in the provisions below accommodates a wheelchair user with an accompanying person.
A larger lift size (2000mm wide by 1400mm deep) will accommodate any type of wheelchair together with several other passengers.
It will also allow a wheelchair user or a person with a walking frame to turn through 180°.
"Lift door systems should be designed to allow adequate time for people, and any assistance dogs, to enter or leave the lift without coming into contact with closing doors."
reached and where in a bank of lifts it is located.
The use of visually and acoustically reflective wall surfaces can cause discomfort for people with visual and hearing impairment.
"Where planning allows, lift cars (used for access between two levels only) may be provided with opposing doors to allow a wheelchair user to leave without reversing out."
Passenger lifts will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
"they conform to the requirements of the Lift Regulations 1997, SI 1997/831 (Note: These regulations may be met by compliance with, among other things, the relevant British Standards, EN 81 series of standards, in particular BS EN 81-70:2003 Safety rules for the construction and installation of lifts."
"Particular applications for passenger and good passenger lifts, or, where necessary, by product certification issued by a Notified Body);"
they are accessible from the remainder of the storey;
the minimum dimensions of the lift cars are 1100mm wide and 1400mm deep (see Diagram 11);
"for lifts of a size that does not allow a wheelchair user to turn around within the lift car, a mirror is provided in the lift car to enable a wheelchair user to see the space behind the wheelchair;"
power-operated horizontal sliding doors provide an effective clear width of at least 800mm (nominal);
doors are fitted with timing devices and re-opening activators to allow adequate time for people and any assistance dogs to enter or leave;
car controls are located between 900mm and 1200mm (preferably 1100mm) from the car floor and at least 400mm from any return wall;
landing call buttons are located between 900mm and 1100mm from the floor of the landing and at least 500mm from any return wall;
lift landing and car doors are distinguishable visually from the adjoining walls;
audible and visual indication of lift arrival and location is provided in the lift car and the lift lobby;
areas of glass are identifiable by people with impaired vision;
"where the lift is to be used to evacuate disabled people in an emergency, it conforms to the relevant recommendations of BS 5588-8."
"A lifting platform should only be provided to transfer wheelchair users, people with impaired mobility and their companions vertically between levels or storeys."
All users including wheelchair users should be able to reach and use the controls that summon and direct the lifting platform.
"People using or waiting for a lifting platform need audible and visual information to tell them that the platform has arrived, and which floor it has reached."
"Lifting platforms travel slowly between landings and may not be suitable for lone users with certain disabilities, e.g. those easily fatigued."
Lifting platforms are operated by continuous pressure controls.
In their simplest form these may be push buttons.
"However, another means of continuous pressure control may need to be considered to accommodate the needs of users with varying degrees of manual dexterity."
It is important when selecting a lifting platform that due care and attention is paid to its intended use particularly if located in an unsupervised environment.
"Where management control cannot be exercised, particular attention should be paid to the product’s designed duty cycle."
"Where planning allows, lifting platforms may be provided with opposing doors when used for access between two levels only, to allow a wheelchair user to leave without reversing out."
"In some cases, it may be more convenient to provide a second door at 90° to the first, in which case a wider platform would be required."
The use of visually and acoustically reflective wall surfaces should be minimised within the lifting platform to prevent discomfort for people with visual and hearing impairment.
Lifting platforms will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if:
"they conform to the requirements of the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 1992, SI 1992/3073 (Note: These regulations may be met by compliance, among other things, with the relevant British Standards, EN81 series of standards or, where necessary, by product certification issued by a Notified Body."
"In the absence of relevant harmonised European Standards, products with a travel exceeding 3m must have a product certificate issued by a Notified Body);"
the vertical travel distance is:
"not more than 2m, where there is no liftway enclosure and no floor penetration;"
"more than 2m, where there is a liftway enclosure;"
the rated speed of the platform does not exceed 0.15m/s;
lifting platform controls are located between 800mm and 1100mm from the floor of the lifting platform and at least 400mm from any return wall;
continuous pressure controls are provided;
landing call buttons are located between 900mm and 1100mm from the floor of the landing and at least 500mm from any return wall;
the minimum clear dimensions of the platform are:
"800mm wide and 1250mm deep, where the lifting platform is not enclosed and where provision is being made for an unaccompanied wheelchair user;"
"900mm wide and 1400mm deep, where the lifting platform is enclosed and where provision is being made for an unaccompanied wheelchair user;"
"Wheelchair platform stairlifts travel slowly between landings and may not be suitable for users with certain disabilities, e.g. those easily fatigued."
1100mm wide and 1400mm deep where two doors are located at 90° relative to each other and where the lifting platform is enclosed or where provision is being made for an accompanied wheelchair user;
"Wheelchair platform stairlifts are operated by continuous pressure controls, commonly a joystick."
"However, another means of continuous pressure control may need to be considered to accommodate users with varying degrees of manual dexterity."
doors have an effective clear width of at least 900mm for an 1100mm wide and 1400mm deep lifting platform and at least 800mm in other cases;
Wheelchair platform stairlifts are only suitable where users can be instructed in their safe use and where management supervision can be ensured.
they are fitted with clear instructions for use;
the lifting platform entrances are accessible from the remainder of the storey;
doors are distinguishable visually from the adjoining walls;
an audible and visual announcement of platform arrival and level reached is provided;
areas of glass are identifiable by people with impaired vision.
Wheelchair platform stairlifts are only intended for the transportation of wheelchair users and should only be considered for conversions and alterations where it is not practicable to install a conventional passenger lift or a lifting platform.
Such stairlifts travel up the string of a stair.
They should not be installed where their operation restricts the safe use of the stair by other people.
A wheelchair platform stairlift allows a wheelchair user to travel independently up and down stairs while remaining seated in a wheelchair.
"A wheelchair platform stairlift may be more suitable for use in small areas with a unique function, e.g. a small library gallery, a staff rest room or a training room."
"Wheelchair platform stairlifts will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if a. they conform to the requirements of the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 1992, SI 1992/3073 (Note: These regulations may be met by compliance, among other things, with the relevant British Standards, EN81 series of standards or where necessary Notified Body approval);"
"in a building with a single stairway, the required clear width of the flight of stairs and landings for means of escape is maintained when the wheelchair platform is in the parked position (see also Approved Document B);"
the rated speed of the platform does not exceed 0.15m/s;
continuous pressure controls are provided;
the minimum clear dimensions of the platform are 800mm wide and 1250mm deep;
they are fitted with clear instructions for use;
access with an effective clear width of at least 800mm is provided;
controls are designed to prevent unauthorised use.
The design considerations for handrails are as those for ‘Handrails to external stepped and ramped access’ in 1.34 to 1.36.
"Handrails to internal steps, stairs and ramps will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if they comply with Approved Document K, sections 1–3."
"With the exception of the need for hazard warning surfaces on landings, other design considerations for internal stairs are as those for ‘Stepped access’ (see 1.29 to 1.32)."
It is not reasonable to require a hazard warning surface at the head of internal stairs since there is no recognised warning surface for use internally which can be guaranteed not to constitute a trip hazard when used alongside flooring surfaces with different frictional resistance characteristics.
"However, designers should be aware of the potential risk of having a stair directly in line with an access route."
"For mobility-impaired people, a going of at least 300mm is preferred."
"Internal stairs will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if they comply with Approved Document K, section 1."
"Note: Diagram 12 has been moved to Approved Document K, Section 1, all other numbering remains the same."
"With the exception of issues relating specifically to the external environment, the design considerations for internal ramps are as those for ‘Ramped access’ (see 1.19 to 1.25)."
It is worth reiterating that ramps are not necessarily safe and convenient for ambulant disabled people.
"For example, some people who can walk but have restricted mobility find it more difficult to negotiate a ramp than a stair."
"Unless, therefore, a ramp is short, has a shallow gradient and the rise is no more than the minimum that can be provided by two risers, steps should be provided as well as a ramp."
"Internal ramps will satisfy Requirement M1 or M2 if they comply with Approved Document K, section 2."
"The aim is for all people to have access to, and the use of, all the facilities provided within buildings."
"They should also be able to participate in the proceedings at lecture/conference facilities and at entertainment or leisure and social venues, not only as spectators, but also as participants and/or staff."
"Where permanent or removable seating is provided as part of the design, allowance should be made for disabled people to have a choice of seating location at spectator events."
It should also be possible for them to have a clear view of the activity taking place while not obstructing the view of others.
"In refreshment facilities, bars and 4.3 counters (or sections of them) should be at a level suitable for wheelchair users."
"All floor areas, even when located at different levels, should be accessible."
"A proportion of the sleeping accommodation in hotels, motels and student accommodation should be designed for independent use by wheelchair users."
"The remainder should include facilities that make them suitable for people who do not use a wheelchair, but may have mobility, sensory, dexterity or learning difficulties."
Audience and spectator facilities fall primarily into three categories:
sports facilities (e.g. stadia).
Note: The guidance here relates mainly to seating.
"For guidance on reception and sales counters, refer to 3.2 to 3.5."
"Wheelchair users and those with mobility or sensory impairment may need to view or listen from a particular side, or sit in the front for lip reading or to read sign interpreters."
"They should be provided with spaces into which they can manoeuvre easily, and which offer them a clear view of an event, while ensuring they are not segregated into special areas."
"Wheelchair users, people who have difficulty in using seats with fixed arms and those with assistance dogs should also have the choice of sitting next to a conventionally seated person or a companion wheelchair user."
Consideration should be given to providing an area next to certain seats for an assistance dog to rest.
"By having some removable seating at the front and back of blocks of seats (possibly in complete rows), greater flexibility in location can be achieved and a greater number of wheelchair users than the minimum provision shown in Table 3 can be accommodated."
"Greater spacing between rows of seats at the rear of a block of seating, or at the end of rows, may provide extra legroom for people of large stature."
"With several seats removed, these locations may also be suitable for wheelchair users."
It is desirable for seating to contrast visually with the surroundings.
"All users of facilities should be able to locate suitable seating and move safely and easily to and from the seating area and ancillary accommodation, such as lavatories, dining rooms and bedroom suites."
"People with hearing impairments should be able to participate fully in conferences, committee meetings and study groups."
All people should be able to use presentation facilities.
"screen) to ensure that patterned walls, poor interior lighting or very bright natural back-lighting does not have a detrimental effect on the ability of people to receive information from a sign language interpreter or a lip speaker (see 4.32 to 4.34)."
"In facilities for entertainment, e.g. theatres and cinemas, it is normal for seating to be more closely packed than in other types of auditoria."
Care is needed in the design and location of wheelchair spaces so that all visitors can enjoy the atmosphere.
Reference should also be made to Technical standard for places of entertainment.
"For guidance on integrating the needs of disabled people into the design of spectator facilities, in particular the provision of, and access to, suitable spaces for wheelchair users in stadia, see Guide to safety at sports grounds, Accessible stadia: a good practice guide to the design of facilities to meet the needs of disabled spectators and other users and accessible sports facilities."
Audience and spectator facilities will satisfy Requirement M1 if:
the route to wheelchair spaces is accessible by wheelchair users;
stepped access routes to audience seating are provided with fixed handrails (see 1.34 to 1.37 for details of handrails);
the minimum number of permanent and removable spaces provided for wheelchair users is in accordance with Table 3;
"For seating capacities of 10,000 or more, guidance is given in ‘Accessible stadia: a good practice guide to the design of facilities to meet the needs of disabled spectators and other users’."
"some wheelchair spaces (whether permanent or created by removing seats) are provided in pairs, with standard seating on at least one side (see Diagram 13);"
"where more than two wheelchair spaces are provided, they are located to give a range of views of the event at each side, as well as at the front and back of the seating area;"
the minimum clear space provided for access to wheelchair spaces is 900mm;
the clear space allowance for an occupied wheelchair in a parked position is 900mm wide by 1400mm deep;
the floor of each wheelchair space is horizontal;
Refreshment facilities will satisfy Requirement M1 if:
all users have access to all parts of the facility;
"part of the working surface of a bar or serving counter is permanently accessible to wheelchair users, and at a level of not more than 850mm above the floor and, where necessary, part at a higher level for people standing;"
the worktop of a shared refreshment facility (e.g. for tea making) is at 850mm above the floor with a clear space beneath at least 700mm above the floor (see Diagram 16) and the delivery of water complies with 5.4(a) and (b);
a wheelchair-accessible threshold (see 2.7(e)) is located at the transition between an external seating area and the interior of the facility.
"some seats are located so that an assistance dog can accompany its owner and rest in front of, or under, the seat;"
"standard seats at the ends of rows and next to wheelchair spaces have detachable, or lift-up, arms;"
For seating on a stepped terraced floor
"wheelchair spaces at the back of a stepped terraced floor are provided in accordance with Diagram 14 or 15, the arrangement in Diagram 15 being particularly suitable for entertainment buildings, such as theatres or cinemas, subject to the approval of the licensing authority;"
"where a podium or stage is provided, wheelchair users have access to it by means of a ramp or lifting platform;"
a hearing enhancement system in accordance with 4.36 is provided for people with impaired hearing.
"Refreshment facilities, such as restaurants and bars, should be designed so that they can be reached and used by all people independently or with companions."
Staff areas should also be accessible.
"All public areas, including lavatory accommodation, public telephones and external terraces should be accessible."
"Where premises contain self-service and waiter service, all patrons should have access to both."
"In many refreshment facilities, changes in level are used to differentiate between different functions or to create a certain atmosphere through interior design."
Changes of floor level are acceptable provided the different levels are accessible.
"Wheelchair-accessible bedrooms should be sufficiently spacious to enable a wheelchair user to transfer to one side of a bed, with or without assistance."
"Wheelchair users should be able to manoeuvre around and use the facilities in the room, and operate switches and controls."
"They should also be able to gain access to and conveniently use sanitary accommodation and, where provided, balconies."
En-suite sanitary facilities are the preferred option for wheelchair-accessible bedrooms.
"Unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so, there should be at least as many en-suite shower rooms as en-suite bathrooms, as mobility-impaired people may find it easier to use a shower than a bath."
"An en-suite shower room or bathroom would benefit from having a finger rinse basin adjacent to the WC, as well as a wash basin or basin in a vanity unit."
"It is also important to ensure that, in all bedrooms, built-in wardrobes and shelving are accessible and convenient to use."
It is an advantage if curtains and blinds are provided with automatic or other remotely controlled opening devices such as rods or pull cords.
"Wheelchair users should also be able to visit companions in other bedrooms, for example when attending conferences or when on holiday with their families."
"In these instances, bedrooms not designed for independent use by a person in a wheelchair need to have the outer door wide enough to be accessible to a wheelchair user."
"accessible bedrooms, it would be useful to provide a connecting door to an adjacent bedroom for a companion."
"For people with limited manual dexterity, electronic card-activated locks for bedroom entrance doors and lever taps in sanitary accommodation can be an advantage."
"Sleeping accommodation, where provided for a significant number of people, e.g. in hotels, motels and student accommodation, should aim to be convenient for all."
People who use wheelchairs are likely to require greater provision of space and access to en-suite sanitary accommodation.
"A proportion of rooms will, therefore, need to accommodate wheelchair users."
"In student accommodation, it is beneficial to have a wheelchair-accessible toilet available for use by disabled visitors."
Wheelchair users should be able to reach all the facilities available within the building.
"In general, accessible bedrooms should be no less advantageously situated than other bedrooms."
"It would be beneficial if entrance doors to wheelchair-accessible bedrooms were powered opening, as this could avoid the need for the 300mm access space adjacent to the leading edge of the door."
Sleeping accommodation will satisfy Requirement M1 if:
the effective clear width of the door from the access corridor complies with Table 2;

openable windows and window controls are located between 800 and 1000mm above the floor and are easy to operate without using both hands simultaneously;
"all bedrooms have a visual fire alarm signal, in addition to the requirements of Part B;"
any room numbers are indicated in embossed characters;
"at least one wheelchair-accessible bedroom is provided for every 20 bedrooms, or part thereof;"
wheelchair-accessible bedrooms are located on accessible routes that lead to all other available facilities within the building;
wheelchair-accessible bedrooms are designed to provide a choice of location and have a standard of amenity equivalent to that of other bedrooms;
"the door from the access corridor to a wheelchair-accessible bedroom complies with the relevant provisions of ‘Internal doors’ (see 3.10), in particular the maximum permissible opening force, Table 2 and the need for a clear space of 300mm from the leading edge of the door to the side wall;"
the effective clear width of any door to an en-suite bathroom or shower room within the wheelchair-accessible bedroom complies with Table 2;
"the size of wheelchair-accessible bedrooms allows for a wheelchair user to manoeuvre at the side of a bed, then transfer independently to it."
An example of a wheelchair-accessible bedroom layout is shown in Diagram 17;
"sanitary facilities, en-suite to a wheelchair-accessible bedroom, comply with the provisions of 5.15 to 5.21 for ‘Wheelchair-accessible bathrooms’ or ‘Wheelchair-accessible shower facilities’;"

"a balcony, where provided to a wheelchair-accessible bedroom, has a door whose effective clear width complies with Table 2, has a level threshold and has no horizontal transoms between 900mm and 1200mm above the floor;"
there are no permanent obstructions in a zone 1500mm back from any balcony doors;
"an emergency assistance alarm (together with a reset button) is located in a wheelchair-accessible bedroom and activated by a pull cord, sited so that it can be operated both from the bed and from an adjacent floor area;"
"an emergency assistance call signal outside an accessible bedroom is located so that it can be easily seen and heard by those able to give assistance and, in any case, at a central control point."
"The key factors that affect the use of switches, outlets and controls are ease of operation, visibility, height and freedom from obstruction."
"However, there will be exceptions to height requirements for some outlets, e.g. those set into the floor in open plan offices."
A consistent relationship with doorways and corners will further reinforce the ease with which people manipulate switches and controls.
"All users should be able to locate a control, know which setting it is on and use it without inadvertently changing its setting."
"Controls that contrast visually with their surroundings are more convenient for visually impaired people, as are light switches that are activated by a large push pad."
The colours red and green should not be used in combination as indicators of ‘on’ and ‘off’ for switches and controls.
It may be useful to use text or a pictogram to clarify the purpose and status of multiple switches and controls.
"It is also an advantage if individual switches on panels and on multiple socket outlets are well separated, or in the form of large touch plates, to avoid the inadvertent selection of an adjacent control by visually impaired people and people with limited dexterity."
"Switches, outlets and controls will satisfy Requirement M1 if:"
"wall-mounted socket outlets, telephone points and TV sockets are located between 400mm and 1000mm above the floor, with a preference for the lower end of the range;"
"switches for permanently wired appliances are located between 400mm and 1200mm above the floor, unless needed at a higher level for particular appliances;"

controls that need close vision are located between 1200mm and 1400mm above the floor so that readings may be taken by a person sitting or standing (with thermostats at the top of the range);
"socket outlets are located consistently in relation to doorways and room corners, but in any case no nearer than 350mm from room corners;"
"light switches for use by the general public have large push pads and align horizontally with door handles within the range 900 to 1100mm, for ease of location when entering a room;"
"where switches described in 4.30(h) cannot be provided, lighting pull cords are set between 900mm and 1100mm above floor level, and fitted with a 50mm diameter bangle visually contrasting with its background and distinguishable visually from any emergency assistance pull cord;"
"j the operation of switches, outlets and controls does not require the simultaneous use of both hands, except where this mode of operation is necessary for safety reasons;"
switched socket outlets indicate whether they are ‘on’;
mains and circuit isolator switches clearly indicate that they are on or off;
front plates contrast visually with their backgrounds.
"People will benefit most if there is an integrated system for wayfinding, public address and hearing enhancement."
"The appropriate choice of floor, wall and ceiling surface materials and finishes can help visually impaired people appreciate the boundaries of rooms or spaces, identify access routes and receive information."
"For example, glare and reflections from shiny surfaces, and large repeating patterns, should be avoided in spaces where visual acuity is critical as they will hamper communication for people with impaired vision, and those who lip read or use sign language."
This would apply to locations such as reception areas with enquiry desks and speakers’ rostrums in lecture halls.
"The type and quality of public address, hearing enhancement and telephone systems should be chosen carefully to ensure intelligibility."
The design of the acoustic environment should also ensure that audible information can be heard clearly.
"Artificial lighting should be designed to give good colour rendering of all surfaces, without creating glare or pools of bright light and strong shadows."
"Where appropriate, lighting should illuminate the face of a person speaking, to make lip reading easier where one-to-one communication is necessary."
Uplighters mounted at low or floor level can disorientate some visually impaired people and should be avoided.
"In order to obtain the full benefit of attending public performances or taking part in discussions, a person with impaired hearing needs to receive a signal that is amplified in both volume and signal to noise ratio."
"The three systems commonly used to provide this enhanced level of sound are induction loop, infrared and radio."
"Sound field systems are also increasingly being used, particularly in educational establishments."
"In larger spaces, provision needs to be made for a permanent system, but in small meeting rooms, a portable induction loop would be acceptable."
It should be recognised that there is the danger where adjacent spaces each have an induction loop system that the signals may overlap.
"Note: Detailed guidance on surface finishes, visual, audible and tactile signs, as well as the characteristics and appropriate choice and use of hearing enhancement systems, is available in BS 8300."
Aids to communication will satisfy Requirement M1 if:
a clearly audible public address system is supplemented by visual information;
"provision for a hearing enhancement system is installed in rooms and spaces designed for meetings, lectures, classes, performances, spectator sport or films, and at service or reception counters when they are situated in noisy areas or they are behind glazed screens;"
the presence of an induction loop or infrared hearing enhancement system is indicated by the standard symbol;
telephones suitable for hearing aid users are clearly indicated by the standard ear and ‘T’ symbol and incorporate an inductive coupler and volume control;
text telephones for deaf and hard of hearing people are clearly indicated by the standard symbol;
artificial lighting is designed to be compatible with other electronic and radio frequency installations.
"In principle, suitable sanitary 5.1 accommodation should be available to everybody, including sanitary accommodation designed for wheelchair users, ambulant disabled people, people of either sex with babies and small children or people encumbered by luggage."
"In multi-storey buildings, the consistent 5.2 location of toilets on each floor can help people with learning difficulties to locate these facilities easily."
A number of issues need to be considered in connection with all forms of sanitary accommodation.
"These relate to the needs of people with visual or hearing impairments, people with learning difficulties and people whose lack of tactile sensitivity can cause them to be injured by touching hot surfaces."
Taps and WC cubicle doors should be operable by people with limited strength or manual dexterity and doors to cubicles should be capable of being opened if a person has collapsed against them while inside the cubicle.
"accessible unisex toilets open out or, if they open in, the door swing should not encroach into the wheelchair turning space or minimum activity space."
"Where possible, light switches with large push pads should be used in preference to pull cords (see 4.28)."
Sanitary accommodation will satisfy Requirement M1 or M3 if:
"any bath or washbasin tap is either controlled automatically, or is capable of being operated using a closed fist, e.g. by lever action;"
"terminal fittings comply with Guidance Note G18.5 of the Guidance Document relating to Schedule 2: Requirements for Water Fittings, of the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999, SI 1999/1148;"
door handles and other ironmongery comply with provisions 3.10 (d) and (e) of ‘Internal doors’;
"WC compartment doors, and doors to wheelchair-accessible unisex toilets, changing rooms or shower rooms are fitted with light action privacy bolts so that they can be operated by people with limited dexterity and, if required to self-close, can be opened using a force at the leading edge of not more than 30N from 0° (the door in the closed position) to 30° open, and not more than 22.5N from 30° to 60° of the opening cycle;"
"WC compartment doors, and doors to wheelchair-accessible unisex toilets, changing rooms or shower rooms have an emergency release mechanism so that they are capable of being opened outwards, from the outside, in case of emergency;"
"doors, when open, do not obstruct emergency escape routes;"
any fire alarm emits a visual and audible signal to warn occupants with hearing or visual impairments;
any emergency assistance alarm system has:
visual and audible indicators to confirm that an emergency call has been received;
"a reset control reachable from a wheelchair and the WC, or from the wheelchair and the shower/ changing seat;"
a signal that is distinguishable visually and audibly from the fire alarm.
"any lighting controls comply with the provisions for ‘Switches and controls’, see 4.30;"
any heat emitters are either screened or have their exposed surfaces kept at a temperature below 43°C;
"the surface finish of sanitary fittings and grab bars contrasts visually with background wall and floor finishes, and there is also visual contrast between wall and floor finishes."
"Toilet accommodation needs to be suitable, not only for disabled people, but for all people who use the building."
"For disabled people, suitable toilet accommodation may take the form of a specially designed cubicle in separate-sex toilet washrooms, or a self- contained unisex toilet."
"For wheelchair users in particular, a self-contained unisex toilet is always the preferred option since, if necessary, a partner or carer of a different sex can enter to give assistance."
accessible accommodation in separate-sex toilet washrooms.
Wheelchair-accessible unisex toilets should not be used for baby changing.
"The provision of an enlarged cubicle in a separate-sex toilet washroom can be of benefit to ambulant disabled people, as well as parents with children and people (e.g. those with luggage) who need an enlarged space."
"In large building developments, separate facilities for baby changing and an enlarged unisex toilet incorporating an adult changing table are desirable."

diagram 48 and Annexes F and G of BS 8300-2:2018.
"Note: For specific guidance on the provision of sanitary accommodation in sports buildings, refer to ‘accessible sports facilities’."
The provision of toilet accommodation will satisfy Requirement M1or
"accessible unisex type, but of greater width to accommodate a standing height wash basin;"
"at least one wheelchair-accessible unisex toilet is provided at each location in a building where sanitary facilities are provided for use by customers and visitors to a building, or by people working in the building;"
at least one WC cubicle is provided in separate-sex toilet accommodation for use by ambulant disabled people;
"where there are four or more WC cubicles in separate-sex toilet accommodation, one of these is an enlarged cubicle for use by people who need extra space, in addition to any provision under 5.7(c);"
at least one changing places toilet is provided in the following types of building:
"assembly, recreation and entertainment buildings (see note) with a capacity for 350 or more people; or a collection of smaller buildings associated with a site used for assembly, recreation or entertainment, such as zoos, theme parks and venues for sport and exhibitions, with a capacity of 2000 people or more; ii."
"shopping centres/malls or retail parks with a gross floor area of 30,000m2 or more;"
retail premises with a gross floor area of 2500m2 or more;
sport and leisure buildings with a gross floor area more than 5000m2;
hospitals and primary care centres;

"Note: Places of assembly, recreation and entertainment can be defined as buildings such as:"
further education colleges;
"hotels that provide function, sport or leisure facilities;"
libraries open to the public;
motorway service areas;
places of worship;
university buildings open to the public;
"or any other buildings or sites as defined by these thresholds, which are open to the public and used for the purpose of assembly, recreation or entertainment."
Capacities should be derived from the combined total of a building’s publicly accessible facilities.
"Alternatively, the capacity number may be taken as the number of fixed seats provided, if the occupants of the building will normally be seated."
"Approved Document B, Volume 2 provides a method for estimating the capacity of a building where this is not known."
The Department for Education will publish separate guidance regarding changing places toilets in schools providing community facilities in 2021.
"Wheelchair users should be able to approach, transfer to and use the sanitary facilities provided within a building."
accessible unisex toilet.
The relationship of the WC to the finger rinse basin and other accessories should allow a person to wash and dry hands while seated on the WC.
The space provided for manoeuvring should enable wheelchair users to adopt various transfer techniques that allow independent or assisted use.
It is important that the transfer space alongside the WC is kept clear to the back wall.
"When transferring to and from their wheelchair, some people need horizontal support rails."
"The rail on the open side is a drop-down rail, but on the wall side, it can be a wall-mounted grab rail (which is thought to give a more rigid handhold) set at a greater distance than normal from the wall or, alternatively, a second drop-down rail in addition to the wall-mounted grab rail where the grab rail is spaced at the minimum distance from the wall and therefore does not give the same degree of support."
A unisex toilet is approached separately from other sanitary accommodation.
"accessible cubicle in a separate-sex toilet washroom and, provided it is used only by disabled people, it is more likely to be available when required."
This is particularly important as some disabled people need to use a toilet more frequently than other users.
accessible toilet should therefore be kept to a minimum when considering the location of unisex toilet accommodation.
"In addition, a unisex toilet enables one or two assistants of either sex to assist a disabled person."
Consideration should be given to installing a chemical sanitary waste disposal unit in wheelchair-accessible WC accommodation.
WC pan can accept a variable height toilet seat riser.
WC pans manufactured to the key dimensions given in BS EN 997:2012 WC pans and WC suites with integral trap would be acceptable.
"Note: More detailed guidance on the various techniques used to transfer from a wheelchair to a WC, as well as appropriate sanitary and other fittings, is given in BS 8300."
Wheelchair-accessible unisex toilets will satisfy Requirement M1 or M3 if:
one is located as close as possible to the entrance and/or waiting area of the building;
they are not located in a way that compromises the privacy of users;
"they are located in a similar position on each floor of a multi-storey building, and allow for right- and left-hand transfer on alternate floors;"
"when more than one unisex toilet is available in other than multi-storey buildings, a choice of layouts suitable for left-hand and right-hand transfer is provided;"
"when it is the only toilet facility in the building, the width is increased from 1.5m to 2m and it includes a standing height washbasin, in addition to the finger rinse basin associated with the WC;"
they are located on accessible routes that are direct and obstruction free;
doors are preferably outward opening and are fitted with a horizontal closing bar fixed to the inside face;
any wheelchair user does not have to travel:
"more than 40m on the same floor, unless a greater distance can be agreed with the building control body on the grounds that the circulation route is unobstructed, e.g. by the installation of doors with hold-open devices;"
"floor of the building, but is accessible by passenger lift (if a lifting platform is installed, vertical travel to a unisex toilet is limited to one storey);"
"the minimum overall dimensions of, and the arrangement of fittings within, a wheelchair-accessible unisex toilet comply with Diagram 18;"
"where the horizontal support rail on the wall adjacent to the WC is set with the minimum spacing from the wall, an additional drop-down rail is provided on the wall side at a distance of 320mm from the centre line of the WC;"
"where the horizontal support rail on the wall adjacent to the WC is set so that its centre line is 400mm from the centre line of the WC, there is no additional drop-down rail;"
"the heights and arrangement of fittings in a wheelchair-accessible unisex toilet comply with Diagram 19 and, as appropriate, Diagram 20;"
"an emergency assistance alarm system is provided, complying with 5.4;"
the emergency assistance call signal outside the toilet compartment is located so that it can be easily seen and heard by those able to give assistance;
an emergency assistance pull cord is easily identifiable (see 4.30(e)) and reachable from the WC and from the floor close to the WC;
"any heat emitters are located so that they do not restrict the minimum clear wheelchair manoeuvring space, nor the space beside the WC used for transfer from the wheelchair to the WC;"
WC pans conform to BS EN 997:2012 in terms of key dimensions in order to accommodate the use of a variable height toilet seat riser (see 5.9);
"cisterns for WCs that will be used by wheelchair users have their flushing mechanism positioned on the open or transfer side of the space, irrespective of handing."
Ambulant disabled people should have the opportunity to use a WC compartment within any separate-sex toilet washroom.
"The compartment should be fitted with support rails, and include a minimum activity space to accommodate people who use crutches, or otherwise have impaired leg movements."
The presence of this facility helps avoid unnecessary travel to unisex toilet accommodation.
"Some ambulant disabled people find it difficult to use a standard height WC seat and, for them, it is important that the WC pan can accept a variable height toilet seat riser."
"Separate-sex toilet washrooms above a certain size should also include an enlarged WC cubicle for use by people who need extra space, e.g. parents with children and babies, people carrying luggage and also ambulant disabled people."
"Consideration should be given to installing a fold-down table, e.g. for baby changing."
Standard WC compartments should also have a minimum manoeuvring space clear of any door swing.
at a lower height than is provided for other users.
The relative numbers of urinals for men and WC compartments for women has been the subject of recent research.
"In general, the findings indicate that there should be at least the same number of WCs (for women) as urinals (for men) and for some building types, e.g. large retail buildings, at least twice as many."
Consideration should be given to providing a low level urinal for children in male washrooms.
Note: More detailed guidance on appropriate sanitary and other fittings is given in BS 8300.
WC compartments within separate-sex toilet washrooms will satisfy Requirement M1 or M3 if:
"the swing of any inward opening doors to standard WC compartments is such that a 450mm diameter manoeuvring space is maintained between the swing of the door, the WC pan and the side wall of the compartment;"
"the minimum dimensions of compartments for ambulant disabled people, including the activity space, and the arrangement of grab bars and other fittings within the compartment, comply with Diagram 21;"
doors to compartments for ambulant disabled people are preferably outward opening and are fitted with a horizontal closing bar fixed to the inside face;
"an enlarged compartment for those who need extra space (based on the compartment for ambulant disabled people) is 1200mm wide and includes a horizontal grab bar adjacent to the WC, a vertical grab bar on the rear wall and space for a shelf and fold-down changing table;"
"any compartment for use by ambulant disabled people has a WC pan that conforms to BS EN 997:2012 in terms of key dimensions, in order to accommodate the use of a variable height toilet seat riser (see 5.9 and 5.11);"
a wheelchair-accessible compartment (where provided) has the same layout and fittings as the unisex toilet;
"any wheelchair-accessible washroom has at least one washbasin with its rim set at 720 to 740mm above the floor and, for men, at least one urinal with its rim set at 380mm above the floor, with two 600mm long vertical grab bars with their centre lines at 1100mm above the floor, positioned either side of the urinal."
A choice of shower layout combined with the correct location of shower controls and fittings will allow disabled people to use the facilities independently or be assisted by others when necessary.
"For guidance on the provision of en-suite shower facilities associated with hotel bedrooms, see 4.19."
"In buildings where changing facilities are associated with showering facilities, many disabled people will be content to use changing and shower areas that are open but provided with subdivisions, whereas some will require the privacy and convenience of an individual self-contained cubicle or compartment."
The dimensions of the self-contained compartment allow space for a helper.
Any combined facility should be divided into distinct ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ areas.
"In open changing and shower areas, it may be difficult to provide a configuration of handrails, controls and seat suitable for all disabled people to use."

a choice of left-hand and right-hand transfer layouts is available when more than one shower area incorporating a corner WC is provided.
Note: Guidance prepared by the Health and Safety Executive on the slip resistance of floor surfaces is given in Annex C of BS 8300.
Wheelchair users and ambulant disabled people should be able to wash or bathe either independently or with assistance from others.
"The relationship of the bath to other sanitary fittings, and to the space required for manoeuvring, is therefore critical."
"Providing a choice of bathroom layout, wherever possible, will meet the needs of many disabled people and help maintain their independence."
"The guidance covered here applies to wheelchair-accessible bathing facilities where provided in buildings such as hotels, motels, relatives’ accommodation in hospitals, and to student accommodation and sports facilities where baths are provided as an alternative, or as a supplement, to showers."
"For guidance on the provision of en-suite bathrooms associated with hotel bedrooms, see 4.19."

This approved document is Approved Document O: Overheating.
It gives guidance on how to comply with Part O of the Building Regulations.
This approved document contains the following sections.
Application 0.3 The guidance in this approved document applies to new residential buildings only.
Residential buildings within the scope of Part O and this approved document are detailed in Table 0.1.
"Dwellings, which includes both dwellinghouses and flats."
"Home, school or other similar establishment, where people sleep on the premises."
The building may be living accommodation for the care or maintenance of any of the following.
"Older and disabled people, due to illness or other physical or mental condition."
People under the age of 5 years.
"Residential college, hall of residence and other student accommodation, and living accommodation for children aged 5 years and older."
Table 0.1 Residential buildings within the scope of this approved documentONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Shared communal rooms and common spaces 0.4 Shared communal rooms and common spaces of buildings containing more than one residential unit fall within the scope of this approved document.
"A unit that contains both living accommodation and space for commercial purposes (e.g. as a workshop or office) should be treated as a residential building, as long as the commercial part can revert to residential use."
The commercial part of a building can revert to residential use if all of the following apply.
There is direct access between the commercial space and the residential accommodation.
The commercial space and the residential accommodation are within the same thermal envelope.
The residential accommodation comprises a substantial proportion of the total area of the unit.
What constitutes a ‘substantial proportion’ should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the building control body.
A large non-residential building that contains a small flat for a manager is not treated as a residential building.
A residential building that contains a room used as an office or utility space is still treated as a residential building.
Mixed-use developments 0.7 The guidance in this approved document applies only to the parts of a mixed-use building that are for residential purposes and any corridor that serves residential units.
The guidance in this approved document is the suggested approach to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations.
Alternative approaches are possible but they should be discussed and agreed with a building control body before building work starts.
"The legal requirements of the Building Regulations must be met, regardless of whether the guidance in this approved document is followed or alternative measures are taken."
"If alternative ways of mitigating overheating are adopted, the overall level of overheating risk reduction should not be lower than the approved document provides."
It is the responsibility of those undertaking the work to demonstrate compliance.
"The approved documents set out what, in ordinary circumstances, may be accepted as one way to comply with the Building Regulations."
"It remains the responsibility of those designing or undertaking building work to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether specific circumstances require additional or alternative measures to achieve compliance with the regulatory requirements."
There are interactions between many of the requirements of the Building Regulations and the following paragraphs provide guidance on some key interactions.
"This approved document, Approved Document O, gives guidance on window openings for removing excess heat from residential buildings."
Approved Document B gives guidance on the size of escape windows.
"Where escape windows are provided to comply with Approved Document B, any extra glazing will impact the risk of overheating."
"This approved document, Approved Document O, includes guidance on providing means of removing excess heat from residential buildings."
"Where openings are used, the amount of ventilation for removing excess heat is likely to be higher than the purge ventilation required for Part F. The higher amount of ventilation applies – see Section 1 or Section 2 of this approved document, depending on the method of compliance."
Ventilation fans might cause combustion gases to spill from open-flued appliances and fill the room instead of going up the flue or chimney.
This can occur even if the combustion appliance and fan are in separate rooms.
The guidance in Approved Document J should be followed when installing and testing ventilation appliances and combustion appliances must operate safely whether or not fans are running.
Solar gains in winter can reduce the amount of space heating required to be delivered by the heating system.
Reducing summer overheating by limiting glazing areas will impact winter solar gains and therefore increase the need for space heating.
"Poorly insulated pipework, particularly in community heating schemes, can be a major contributor to overheating."
Control of heat losses from pipework is dealt with under Part L of the Building Regulations and the guidance in Approved Document L should be followed.
"This approved document, Approved Document O, gives guidance on security considerations when providing large openings for removing excess heat."
The locking systems of windows and doors should also conform to guidance given in Approved Document Q on the security of doors and windows in dwellings.
This section deals with requirement O1 of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
limit unwanted solar gains in summer;
provide an adequate means to remove heat from the indoor environment.
"account must be taken of the safety of any occupant, and their reasonable enjoyment of the residence; and"
mechanical cooling may only be used where insufficient heat is capable of being removed from the indoor environment without it.
The aim of requirement O1 is to protect the health and welfare of occupants of the building by reducing the occurrence of high indoor temperatures.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement O1 is met by designing and constructing the building to achieve both of the following."
Limiting unwanted solar gains in summer.
Providing an adequate means of removing excess heat from the indoor environment.
The guidance and regulations are written for the purposes of protecting health and welfare.
Following this guidance does not guarantee the comfort of building occupants.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, compliance with requirement O1 can be demonstrated by using one of the following methods."
"The simplified method for limiting solar gains and providing a means of removing excess heat, as set out in Section 1. b."
"The dynamic thermal modelling method, as set out in Section 2."
This section details a simplified method for demonstrating compliance with requirement O1.
It is suitable for any building within the scope of requirement O1. NOTE:
Appendix B of this approved document includes a compliance checklist.
The designer may use this checklist to demonstrate compliance to building control bodies.
"For the simplified method, the strategy to reduce overheating risk should be selected according to the location of the new residential building and whether it has cross-ventilation, following paragraphs 1.3 to 1.5."
"For the purposes of following the simplified method, the building’s overheating risk category is determined by its location in one of the following areas."
"‘Moderate risk’ location – England, excluding high risk parts of London in (b)."
‘High risk’ location – urban and some suburban parts of London detailed in Appendix C.
Appendix C also provides guidance for some parts of central Manchester.
"For the purposes of following the simplified method, it should be identified whether the dwellinghouse or each residential unit, shared communal room and common space is able to have cross-ventilation, i.e. it has openings on opposite façades."
"Having openings on façades that are not opposite does not meet the approved document definition of cross-ventilation, e.g. in a corner flat."
A multi-occupancy residential building should not be categorised as having or not having cross-ventilation.
"Each residential unit, shared communal room and common space should be categorised separately."
The building’s overheating risk category based on location and whether it is cross-ventilated should be used to select the relevant guidance for both of the following purposes.
To limit unwanted solar gains in summer – follow paragraphs 1.6 to 1.9.
To provide an appropriate means of removing excess heat from the indoor environment – follow paragraphs 1.10 to 1.13.
"To limit solar gains, all of the following standards should be followed."
The maximum glazing area of the building or part of the building given in Table 1.1 or Table 1.2.
This should be determined using the orientation of the façade that has the largest area of glazing.
The maximum glazing area of the most glazed room given in Table 1.1 or Table 1.2.
This should be determined using the orientation of the façade that has the largest area of glazing.
"Shading for buildings in the high risk location, following paragraph 1.9."
O1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 1.7 Buildings or parts of buildings with cross-ventilation should not exceed the maximum glazing areas in Table 1.1.
Floor area and floor area of room are as defined in Appendix A. 1.8 Buildings or parts of buildings with no cross-ventilation should not exceed the maximum glazing areas in Table 1.2.
Floor area and floor area of room are as defined in Appendix A.
"Residential buildings in the high risk location should, in addition to following the maximum glazing areas in Table 1.1 and Table 1.2, provide shading for glazed areas between compass points north-east and north-west via the south."
Shading should be provided by one of the following means.
External shutters with means of ventilation.
Glazing with a maximum g-value of 0.4 and a minimum light transmittance of 0.7.
Overhangs with 50 degrees altitude cut-off on due south-facing façades only.
Buildings or parts of buildings with cross-ventilation should equal or exceed the minimum free areas in Table 1.3.
"The total minimum free area is the free area for the whole dwellinghouse, residential unit, shared communal room or common space, including any bedrooms."
‘Floor area’ is a key term.
See Appendix A.
‘Glazing area’ is a key term.
See Appendix A.
‘Floor area of the room’ is a key term.

Openings should be designed to achieve the free areas in paragraphs 1.10 and 1.11.
The equivalent area of the opening should meet or exceed the free area of the opening.
The equivalent area of the opening should be assessed by either of the following means.
Measurement of the product to BS EN 13141-1.
Calculation using Appendix D.
A system for purge ventilation should be provided in each habitable room to demonstrate compliance with Part F of the Building Regulations.
"The guidance in Section 1 of Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings gives minimum standards for purge ventilation."
"When following this simplified method, applying the guidance in paragraphs 1.10 to 1.12 will usually result in free areas that exceed the free areas in Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings."
The simplified method is not suitable for buildings with more than one residential unit which use a communal heating or hot water system with significant amounts of horizontal heating or hot water distribution pipework.
Main distribution routes should be through vertical risers to minimise heat gains into common spaces.
O1Table 1.3 Minimum free areas for buildings or parts of buildings with cross-ventilation Table 1.4 Minimum free areas for buildings or parts of buildings without cross-ventilationONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION Section 2: Dynamic thermal modelling 2.1 This section details a dynamic thermal modelling method for demonstrating compliance with requirement O1.
It provides a standardised approach to predicting overheating risk for residential buildings using dynamic thermal modelling as an alternative to the simplified method in Section 1. 2.2 The methodology is suitable for all residential buildings.
It may offer the designer additional design flexibility over the solutions in Section 1 in the following situations.
Residential buildings with very high levels of insulation and airtightness.
"Residential buildings with specific site conditions that mean the building is not well represented by the two locations in paragraph 1.3, for example Manchester city centre (see Appendix C)."
Local microclimates may not be well reflected by the geographically closest weather file.
"Residential buildings that are highly shaded by neighbouring properties, structures or landscape."
"Dynamic thermal modelling method 2.3 To demonstrate compliance using the dynamic thermal modelling method, all of the following guidance should be followed."
CIBSE’s TM59 methodology for predicting overheating risk.
The limits on the use of CIBSE’s TM59 methodology set out in paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6.
The acceptable strategies for reducing overheating risk in paragraphs 2.7 to 2.11.
The building control body should be provided with a report that demonstrates that the residential building passes CIBSE’s TM59 assessment of overheating.
"This report should contain the details in CIBSE’s TM59, section 2.3."
Appendix B of this approved document includes a compliance checklist.
The designer may use this checklist to demonstrate compliance to the building control body.
CIBSE’s TM59 method requires the modeller to make choices.
"The dynamic thermal modelling method in this section applies limits to these choices, which are detailed in paragraph 2.6."
These limits should be applied when following the guidance in CIBSE’s TM59.
"All of the following limits on CIBSE’s TM59, section 3.3, apply."
"When a room is occupied during the day (8am to 11pm), openings should be modelled to do all of the following."
Start to open when the internal temperature exceeds 22°C.
Be fully open when the internal temperature exceeds 26°C.
Start to close when the internal temperature falls below 26°C.
O1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION b.
"At night (11pm to 8am), openings should be modelled as fully open if both of the following apply."
The opening is on the first floor or above and not easily accessible.
The internal temperature exceeds 23°C at 11pm.
"When a ground floor or easily accessible room is unoccupied, both of the following apply."
"In the day, windows, patio doors and balcony doors should be modelled as open, if this can be done securely, following the guidance in paragraph 3.7 below."
"At night, windows, patio doors and balcony doors should be modelled as closed."
"An entrance door should be included, which should be shut all the time."
Limiting solar gains 2.7 Solar gains in summer should be limited by any of the following means.
"Fixed shading devices, comprising any of the following."
"Glazing design, involving any of the following solutions."
Depth of the window reveal.
"Building design – for example, the placement of balconies."
"Shading provided by adjacent permanent buildings, structures or landscaping."
"Although internal blinds and curtains provide some reduction in solar gains, they should not be taken into account when considering whether requirement O1 has been met."
"Foliage, such as tree cover, can provide some reduction in solar gains."
"However, it should not be taken into account when considering whether requirement O1 has been met."
Examples of solar shading and their effectiveness are provided in the Building Research Establishment’s BR 364 Solar Shading of Buildings.
Excess heat should be removed from the residential building by any of the following means.
Opening windows (the effectiveness of this method is improved by cross-ventilation).
Ventilation louvres in external walls.
A mechanical ventilation system.
The building should be constructed to meet requirement O1 using passive means as far as reasonably practicable.
It should be demonstrated to the building control body that all practicable passive means of limiting unwanted solar gains and removing excess heat have been used first before adopting mechanical cooling.
Any mechanical cooling (air-conditioning) is expected to be used only where requirement O1 cannot be met using openings.
Any method to reduce overheating risk in residential buildings must comply with all other parts of the Building Regulations.
"Particular attention should be paid to the requirements of Part F and the guidance in Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings on noise and maintenance."
A system for purge ventilation should be provided in each habitable room to demonstrate compliance with Part F of the Building Regulations.
"The guidance in Section 1 of Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings should be followed for the minimum standards for purge ventilation."
"A larger amount of purge ventilation may be required than that in Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings in order to satisfy requirement O1 on providing an adequate means to remove excess heat from the indoor environment."
This section deals with requirement O1(2)(a) of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
limit unwanted solar gains in summer;
provide an adequate means to remove heat from the indoor environment.
"account must be taken of the safety of any occupant, and their reasonable enjoyment of the residence; and"
mechanical cooling may only be used where insufficient heat is capable of being removed from the indoor environment without it.
"Intention In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement O1(2)(a) is met in a new residential building if the building’s overheating mitigation strategy for use by occupants takes account of all of the following."
Noise at night – paragraphs 3.2 to 3.4.
Security – paragraphs 3.6 and 3.7.
Protection from falling – paragraphs 3.8 to 3.10.
Protection from entrapment – paragraph 3.11.
The standards in this section may mean that the standards of the simplified method cannot be met.
"For example, if external noise is an issue, it is unlikely that windows would be opened by an occupant and therefore the minimum free areas of the simplified method cannot be met."
"In such cases, dynamic thermal modelling should be used."
"In locations where external noise may be an issue (for example, where the local planning authority considered external noise to be an issue at the planning stage), the overheating mitigation strategy should take account of the likelihood that windows will be closed during sleeping hours (11pm to 7am)."
Windows are likely to be closed during sleeping hours if noise within bedrooms exceeds the following limits.
"40dB LAeq,T, averaged over 8 hours (between 11pm and 7am)."
"55dB LAFmax, more than 10 times a night (between 11pm and 7am)."
"Where in-situ noise measurements are used as evidence that these limits are not exceeded, measurements should be taken in accordance with the Association of Noise Consultants’ Measurement of Sound Levels in Buildings with the overheating mitigation strategy in use."
"Guidance on reducing the passage of external noise into buildings can be found in the National Model Design Code: Part 2 – Guidance Notes (MHCLG, 2021) and the Association of Noise Consultants’ Acoustics, Ventilation and Overheating: Residential Design Guide (2020)."
Buildings located near to significant local pollution sources should be designed to minimise the intake of external air pollutants.
"Guidance is given in Section 2 of Approved Document F, Volume 1: Dwellings."
"When determining the free area available for ventilation during sleeping hours, only the proportion of openings that can be opened securely should be considered to provide useful ventilation."
"This particularly applies in the following locations, where openings may be vulnerable to intrusion by a casual or opportunistic burglar."
Ground floor bedrooms.
Easily accessible bedrooms.
Open windows or doors can be made secure by using any of the following.
Fixed or lockable louvred shutters.
Fixed or lockable window grilles or railings.
Openings which are intended to be open for long periods to reduce overheating risk might pose a higher risk of falls from height.
Only the proportion of openings which can be opened with a very low risk of occupants falling from height should be considered to form part of the overheating mitigation strategy.
Openings that can be opened wider than 100mm may form part of the overheating mitigation strategy where they meet all of the following conditions.
Window handles on windows that open outwards are not more than 650mm from the inside face of the wall when the window is at its maximum openable angle.
Guarding meets the minimum standards in Table 3.1.
Guarding does not allow children to easily climb it.
"For example, horizontal bars should generally be avoided."
To ensure safe operation it may be necessary to reduce the size of the outward opening windows and provide more windows to meet the required free area.
"This approved document has increased levels of protection from falling compared to Approved Document K. Where applicable, the higher standard applies."
Guarding should be sized to prevent the passage of a 100mm sphere.
"Guarding for large openings could include, but is not limited to, either of the following."
Shutters with a child-proof lock.
"Louvered shutters, window railings and ventilation grilles should not allow body parts to become trapped."
They should comply with all of the following.
Not allow the passage of a 100mm diameter sphere.
Any hole which allows the passage of an 8mm diameter rod should also allow the passage of a 25mm diameter rod.
Such holes should not taper in a way that allows finger entrapment.
Any looped cords must be fitted with child safety devices.
This section deals with the requirements of regulation 40B of the Building Regulations 2010.
This regulation applies to building work in respect of a building where Part O of Schedule 1 applies.
"The person carrying out the work must, not later than five days after the work has been completed, give sufficient information to the owner about the provision made in accordance with Part O so that the systems in place further to Part O can be operated in such a manner as to protect against overheating."
"When a new residential building is erected, information about the building must be given to the owner of the building to allow them to use the overheating mitigation strategy effectively."
"In the Secretary of State’s view, regulation 40B is met by providing information in accordance with Section 4."
Sufficient information about the overheating mitigation strategy and its maintenance requirements must be given to owners so that it can be used effectively.
"The information should be provided in a clear manner, for a non-technical audience."
"The following information should be provided, where relevant."

The information in paragraph 4.2 should be provided in this section of the Home User Guide.
Information about ventilation and the conservation of fuel and power is required under different regulations and guidance is given in Approved Document F (Ventilation) and Approved Document L (Conservation of fuel and power).
"Where the system provides more than one function, the owner should be informed of each separate function."
The definitions below apply to this document only and are not intended to be applied in other circumstances.
Building control body A local authority or an approved inspector.
"Common spaces Spaces which are used mainly for circulation, e.g. a corridor or lift lobby."
Cross-ventilation The ability to ventilate using openings on opposite façades of a dwelling.
"Having openings on façades that are not opposite is not allowing cross-ventilation, e.g. in a corner flat."
Dynamic thermal modelling A method of building modelling that predicts the internal conditions and energy demands of a building at short time intervals using weather data and building characteristics.
Easily accessible Defined as one of the following.
"• A window or doorway, any part of which is within 2m vertically of an accessible level surface, such as the ground or basement level, or an access boundary."
• A window within 2m vertically of a flat or sloping roof (with a pitch of less than 30 degrees) that is within 3.5m of ground level.
Effective area The area through which air flows after the resistance of airflow has been taken into account.
Equivalent area A measure of the aerodynamic performance of an opening.
"It is the area of a sharp-edged circular orifice through which air would pass at the same volume flow rate, under an identical applied pressure difference, as through the opening under consideration."
"Floor area The area of the residential unit, measured to the internal face of the perimeter walls at each floor level."
This area is the gross internal area as measured in accordance with the Code of Measuring Practice by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).
"Floor area of the room The area of the room, measured to the internal face of the perimeter walls."
"Where a room serves more than one activity, e.g. open-plan kitchen and living room, the area with the largest glazing area should be assessed and the room area calculated based on a room depth no greater than 4.5m from the glazed façade."
Free area The geometric open area of a ventilation opening.
This area assumes a clear sharp-edged orifice that would have a coefficient of discharge (Cd) of 0.62.
"Glazing area The area of transparent material, not including the window frame."
"Guarding A barrier that denies people access to another area, for example the floor below."
Louvre A set of angled slats that allow air or light to pass through.
Passive means Any means of cooling a building which is not mechanical cooling (e.g. air conditioning).
Openable windows or mechanical ventilation fans are considered to be passive means of cooling.
Purge ventilation Ventilation of rooms or spaces at a relatively high rate to rapidly dilute pollutants and/or disperse water vapour.
Residential units Habitable rooms or a suite of habitable rooms.
"Examples of a residential unit include, but are not limited to, a flat or rooms that are similar to a flat in care homes or student halls of residence."
"Shared communal rooms Rooms in buildings containing dwellings or residential units, which provide facilities for the residents, e.g. a shared living room, kitchen or laundry room."
"This compliance checklist is divided into three parts, as follows."
Part 1 contains the building details and declarations.
Part 2a functions as a design checklist for the simplified approach detailed in Section 1.
Part 2b functions as a design checklist for the dynamic thermal modelling approach detailed in Section 2. d. Part 3 is for verifying the completion details of the as-built residential building.
All three parts of the compliance checklist should be completed.
The relevant parts of Part 2 and 3 should be signed by a person who is competent to design the residential building.
"A copy of this checklist, or a similar checklist, may be submitted to the building control body as evidence that the building has been constructed as designed to reduce the risk of overheating."

This appendix provides a list of the areas deemed to have a high risk of the buildings within them overheating.
"This appendix should be used with the simplified method to categorise residential buildings, following paragraph 1.3."
The postcodes in Table C1 are in the high risk part of London.
"Diagram C1 also shows the high risk part of London, where a higher standard of risk mitigation is needed."
"Central Manchester (postcodes M1, M2, M3, M5, M15, M16 and M50) may also have elevated night time temperatures."
Consider following the guidance for higher risk locations for buildings in these postcodes.
The free areas in Section 1 of this approved document are geometric open areas that assume a clear sharp-edged orifice with a 0.62 coefficient of discharge (Cd).
Different opening types will reduce the amount of air flow by both affecting the way air flows and reducing the physical area.
Accounting for these factors gives the equivalent area.
The equivalent area of a window can be calculated using one of the following.
publications/classvent-and-classcool-school-ventilation-design-tool.
Tables D1 to D9.
"As stated in paragraph 1.12, measurement of equivalent area to BS EN 13141-1 is also appropriate."
Measurement of equivalent area is more accurate than calculation and is therefore preferable.
Using Tables D1 to D9 to calculate equivalent area is appropriate for the following types of window.
"Side, top or bottom hung windows."
The opening hinge length is referenced as ‘h’ in the tables – Diagram D1 shows this for a side hung window.
"To use the tables for bottom and top hung windows, the ‘h’ and ‘w’ should be reversed."
Centre pivot windows.
"Each of the two sections of the centrally hinged window should be assessed as a single side, bottom or top hung window."
"The opening should be assessed using Table D9, assuming an opening angle of 90 degrees."

This approved document gives guidance on how to comply with Part P of the Building Regulations.
It contains the following sections:
Appendix B: Standards referred to.
Other parts of the Building Regulations contain requirements that affect electrical installations.
"Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:"
Part M (Access to and use of buildings): height of socket-outlets and switches.
Requirement P1: Design and installation This approved document deals with the following requirement from Part P of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
Reasonable provision shall be made in the design Reasonable provision shall be made in the design P1.P1.
"Reasonable provision shall be made in the design and installation of electrical installations in order to and installation of electrical installations in order to and installation of electrical installations in order to protect persons operating, maintaining or altering the protect persons operating, maintaining or altering the protect persons operating, maintaining or altering the installations from fire or injury."

"In the Secretary of State’s view, the requirements of Part P will be met if low voltage and extra-low voltage electrical installations in dwellings are designed and installed so that both of the following conditions are satisfied."
They afford appropriate protection against mechanical and thermal damage.
They do not present electric shock and fire hazards to people.
Electrical installations should be designed and installed in accordance with BS 7671:2008 incorporating Amendment No 1:2011.
"Sufficient information should be provided to ensure that people can operate, maintain or alter an electrical installation with reasonable safety."
The information should comprise items listed in BS 7671 and other appropriate information including:
"for unusually large or complex installations only, detailed plans."
Part P of the Building Regulations covers the safety of electrical installation work; it does not cover system functionality.
"Other parts of the Building Regulations and other legislation cover the functionality of electrically powered products such as fire alarm systems, fans and pumps."
"Wall-mounted socket-outlets, switches and consumer units in new dwellings should be easy to reach, in accordance with Part M of the Building Regulations (Access to and use of buildings)."
outlets for lighting and other equipment should be between 450mm and 1200mm from finished floor level.
Approved Document M does not recommend a height for new consumer units.
"However, one way of complying with Part M in new dwellings is to mount consumer units so that the switches are between 1350mm and 1450mm above floor level."
"At this height, the consumer unit is out of reach of young children yet accessible to other people when standing or sitting."
"Where a material change of use creates a new dwelling, or changes the number of dwellings in a building, regulation 6 requires that any necessary work is carried out to ensure that the building complies with requirement P1."
This means that in some cases the existing electrical installation will need to be upgraded to meet current standards.
"If existing cables are adequate, it is not necessary to replace them, even if they use old colour codes."
"Regulation 4(3) states that when building work is complete, the building should be no more unsatisfactory in terms of complying with the applicable parts of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations than before the building work was started."
"Therefore, when extending or altering an electrical installation, only the new work must meet current standards."
There is no obligation to upgrade the existing installation unless either of the following applies.
The new work adversely affects the safety of the existing installation.
The state of the existing installation is such that the new work cannot be operated safely.
Any new work should be carried out in accordance with BS 7671.
The existing electrical installation should be checked to ensure that the following conditions are all satisfied.
The rating and condition of existing equipment belonging to both the consumer and to the electricity distributor are suitable for the equipment to carry the additional loads arising from the new work.
Adequate protective measures are used.
The earthing and equipotential bonding arrangements are satisfactory.
"All electrical installation work carried out in a dwelling is subject to requirement P1, and should comply with the design and installation guidance in Section 1."
Section 2 sets out:
the types of electrical work that are notifiable and must be certified as complying with the Building Regulations.
Certification procedures are set out in Section 3.
Part P applies to electrical installations:
"in a dwelling-house or flat, and to parts of the installation that are:"
"in outbuildings such as sheds, detached garages and domestic greenhouses."
in business premises (other than agricultural buildings) connected to the same meter as the electrical installation in a dwelling – for example shops and public houses below flats.
Part P does not apply to electrical installations:
that supply the power for lifts in blocks of flats (but Part P does apply to lift installations in single dwellings).
"Schedule 2 to the Building Regulations identifies buildings – for example unoccupied, agricultural, temporary and small detached buildings – that are generally exempt from the requirements of the Regulations."
"However, conservatories, porches, domestic greenhouses, garages and sheds that share their electricity with a dwelling are not exempt from Part P (by virtue of regulation 9(3)) and must comply with its requirements."
The scope of Part P is illustrated in Diagram 1.
Electrical installation work that is notifiable is set out in regulation 12(6A).
the installation of a new circuit;
the installation of a new circuit;
the replacement of a consumer unit; or
the replacement of a consumer unit; or
any addition or alteration to existing circuits in a special location.
any addition or alteration to existing circuits in a special location.
a height of 2.25 metres; or
(aa) a height of 2.25 metres; or
ceiling at a point higher than 2.25 metres from that level; and
ceiling at a point higher than 2.25 metres from that level; and
tub or shower tray to a distance of 0.6 metres; or

distance of 1.2 metres; or
a room containing a swimming pool or sauna heater.
a room containing a swimming pool or sauna heater.
"Diagram 2 illustrates the space around a bath tub or shower tray (a special location) within which minor additions and alterations to existing circuits, as well as the installation of new circuits, are notifiable."
Bath tub or
Regulation 12(6A) sets out electrical installation work that is notifiable.
"All other electrical installation work is not notifiable – namely additions and alterations to existing installations outside special locations, and replacements, repairs and maintenance anywhere."
"Installing fixed electrical equipment is within the scope of Part P, even if the final connection is by a standard 13A plug and socket, but is notifiable only if it involves work set out in regulation 12(6A)."
"connecting an electric gate or garage door to an existing isolator switch is not notifiable work, but installing a new circuit from the consumer unit to the isolator is notifiable."
"Installing prefabricated, modular wiring (for example for kitchen lighting systems) linked by plug and socket connectors is also within the scope of Part P, but again is notifiable only if it involves work set out in regulation 12(6A)."
"For notifiable electrical installation work, one of the following three procedures must be used to certify that the work complies with the requirements set out in the Building Regulations."
Self-certification by a registered competent person.
Third-party certification by a registered third-party certifier.
Certification by a building control body.
"To verify that the design and installation of electrical work is adequate, and that installations will be safe to use, maintain and alter, the electrical work should be inspected and tested in accordance with the procedures in BS 7671."
Electrical inspection and test forms should be given to the person ordering the work.
"Building Regulations certificates should normally be given to the occupier, but in the case of rented properties may be given to the person ordering the work and copied to the occupier."
Electrical installers who are registered competent persons should complete a BS 7671 electrical installation certificate for every job they undertake.
The electrical installer should give the certificate to the person ordering the work.
The installer or the installer’s registration body must within 30 days of the work being completed do both of the following.
Give a copy of the Building Regulations compliance certificate to the occupier.
"Give the certificate, or a copy of the information on the certificate, to the building control body."
"Certification by a registered third party 3.5 Before work begins, an installer who is not a registered competent person may appoint a registered third-party certifier to inspect and test the work as necessary."
"Within 5 days of completing the work, the installer must notify the registered third-party certifier who, subject to the results of the inspection and testing being satisfactory, should then complete an electrical installation condition report and give it to the person ordering the work."
The electrical installation condition report should be the model BS 7671 form or one developed specifically for Part P purposes.
The registration body of the third-party certifier must within 30 days of a satisfactory condition report being issued do both of the following.
Give a copy of the Building Regulations compliance certificate to the occupier.
"Give the certificate, or a copy of the information on the certificate, to the building control body."
"If an installer is not a registered competent person and has not appointed a registered third-party certifier, then before work begins the installer must notify a building control body."
"The building control body will determine the extent of inspection and testing needed for it to establish that the work is safe, based on the nature of the electrical work and the competence of the installer."
"The building control body may choose to carry out any necessary inspection and testing itself, or it may contract a specialist to carry out some or all of the work and furnish it with an electrical installation condition report."
"An installer who is competent to carry out inspection and testing should give the appropriate BS 7671 certificate to the building control body, who will then take the certificate and the installer’s qualifications into account in deciding what further action, if any, it needs to take."
Building control bodies may ask installers for evidence of their qualifications.
"This can result in a lower building control charge as, when setting its charge, a local authority is required by the Building (Local Authority Charges) Regulations 2010 to take account of the amount of inspection work that it considers it will need to carry out."
"Once the building control body has decided that, as far as can be ascertained, the work meets all Building Regulations requirements, it will issue to the occupier a Building Regulations completion certificate (if a local authority) or a final certificate (if an approved inspector)."
"-notifiable electrical installation work, like notifiable work, should be designed and installed, and inspected, tested and certificated in accordance with BS 7671."
"If local authorities find that non-notifiable work is unsafe and non-compliant, they can take enforcement action."

This approved document gives guidance on how to comply with requirement Q1 of the Building Regulations.
It contains the following sections:
The guidance in this approved document applies to new dwellings only; this includes dwellings formed by a material change of use.
This approved document deals with the following requirement from Part Q of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
any dwelling; and
any part of a building from which access can be gained to a flat within the building.
Requirement Q1 applies only in relation to new dwellings.
Requirement Q1 applies to easily accessible doors and windows that provide access in any of the following circumstances:
into a flat from the common parts of the building.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, doors and windows will meet requirement Q1 if they can resist physical attack by a casual or opportunist burglar by being both:"
sufficiently robust b. fitted with appropriate hardware.
All easily accessible doorsets (including garage doorsets and communal entrance doorsets) that provide access into a dwelling or into a building containing a dwelling should be secure doorsets in accordance with paragraphs 1.2 to 1.4.
"If a garage has no interconnecting doorset allowing access into the dwelling, garage doorsets need not be secure doorsets."
"Where access to the dwelling can be gained via an interconnecting doorset from the garage, then either the garage doorset (pedestrian and vehicular) or the interconnecting doorset should be a secure doorset."
Secure doorsets should be either:
"manufactured to a design that has been shown by test to meet the security requirements of British Standards publication PAS 24:2012, or b. designed and manufactured in accordance with Appendix B."
Doorsets satisfying other standards that provide similar or better performance are also acceptable.

"Letter plates, where provided, should: a. have a maximum aperture of 260mm x 40mm, and"
"be located and/or designed to hinder anyone attempting to remove keys with sticks and/or insert their hand, for example by incorporating a flap or other features to restrict access."
Letter plates meeting the requirements of the Door and Hardware Federation’s (DHF) technical specification TS 008:2012 have been shown to protect against the attacks mentioned above.
"The main doors for entering a dwelling (usually the front door) should have a door viewer unless other means exist to see callers, such as clear glass within the door or a window next to the doorset."
The same doorset should also have a door chain or door limiter.
"In some situations a door chain or limiter is not appropriate, for example where a warden may need emergency access to residents in sheltered housing."
"Alternative caller-identification measures, such as electronic audio-visual door entry systems, can be used to identify visitors."
Frames should be mechanically fixed to the structure of the building in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
Lightweight framed walls should incorporate a resilient layer to reduce the risk of anyone breaking through the wall and accessing the locking system.
"The resilient layer should be timber sheathing at least 9mm thick, expanded metal or a similar resilient material."
The resilient layer should be to the full height of the door and 600mm either side of the doorset.
"Ground floor, basement and other easily accessible windows (including easily accessible rooflights) should be secure windows in accordance with paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3."
Windows should be made to a design that has been shown by test to meet the security requirements of British Standards publication PAS 24:2012.
Windows satisfying other standards that provide similar or better performance are also acceptable.
These standards include:
• LPS 2081 Issue 1:2015 security rating A.
Further advice is available in Secured by Design’s New Homes 2014.
Frames should be mechanically fixed to the structure of the building in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.

"The main doors for entering a dwelling (usually the front doorset) should be fitted with a multipoint locking system that meets the requirements of: • PAS 3621 (key locking on both sides), or • PAS 8621 (non-key locking on the internal face), or • PAS 10621 (non-key locking on the internal face, but with an external locking override facility)."
"If it is not practical or desirable to install a multipoint locking system, a mortice lock that conforms with one of the following standards can be fitted instead, with a surface-mounted rim lock that conforms to the same standard: • BS 3621 (key locking both sides), or • BS 8621 (non-key locking on the internal face), or • BS 10621 (non-key locking on the internal face, but with an external locking override facility)."
"Between the locking points for the mortice lock and surface-mounted rim lock, the distance should be 400–600mm."
"The non-primary doors for entering a dwelling (for example, back door or garage interconnecting doors) should be fitted with a multipoint locking system that meets the requirements of:"
"• PAS 10621 (non-key locking on the internal face, but with an external locking override facility)."
"If it is not practical or desirable to install a multipoint locking system, a mortice lock that conforms with one of the following standards can be fitted instead, with two morticed bolts."
"• BS 3621 (key locking both sides), or • BS 8621 (non-key locking on the internal face), or • BS 10621 (non-key locking on the internal door face, but with an external locking override facility)."
"The morticed bolts should have a minimum projection of 20mm, should be at least 100mm from the top and bottom corners of the door, and should avoid any door construction joints."
Hinges accessible from outside should incorporate hinge bolts.
"Letter plates, where provided, should: a. have a maximum aperture of 260mm x 40mm, and b. incorporate a flap or other features designed to hinder anyone attempting to remove keys with sticks and/or insert their hand."
Letter plates meeting the requirements of the Door and Hardware Federation’s (DHF’s) technical specification TS 008:2012 have been shown to protect against the attacks mentioned above.
"The main doors for entering a dwelling (usually the front door) should have a door viewer unless other means exist to see callers, such as clear glass within the door or a window next to the doorset."
The same doorset should also have a door chain or door limiter.
"In some situations a door chain or limiter is not appropriate, for example where a warden may need emergency access to residents in sheltered housing."
Alternative caller-identification measures such as electronic audio-visual door entry systems can be used to identify visitors.
"Any glazing which, if broken, would permit someone to insert their hand and release the locking device on the inside of the door should be a minimum of class P1A in accordance with BS EN 356:2000."

"This approved document, Approved Document R, Volume 1, provides guidance on how to comply with requirement RA1 and requirement RA2 of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations, which respectively deal with the installation of gigabit-ready physical infrastructure and a connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network when new dwellings are erected."
It contains the following sections:
Appendix C: Documents referred to.
This approved document provides guidance on when the requirement for a connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network for new dwellings may be modified or excluded.
This approved document provides guidance on the particulars to be provided when submitting applications for Building Regulations approval.
"A separate approved document, Approved Document R, Volume 2, provides guidance on the requirements for in-building physical infrastructure for high-speed electronic communications networks when new buildings are erected or when existing buildings are subject to major renovation works (paragraph R1 does not apply to building work to which paragraph RA1 applies, e.g. when new dwellings are erected)."
This section deals with requirement RA1 from Part R of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 2010.
"a distribution point, or"
"ready physical infrastructure in land in which it would have to be installed if it were to reach a distribution point, as close as is reasonably practicable to a distribution point, or"
"as close as is reasonably practicable to a location at which a distribution point is likely to be installed within the relevant 2-year period (a “likely future location”), or"
"where there is no likely future location that is closer to the building than the closest distribution point already installed, an access point for gigabit-capable public electronic communications networks, or"
capable public electronic communications networks.
"Where the work concerns a building containing more than one dwelling, the work must be carried out so as to ensure that the building is equipped in addition with a common access point for gigabit-capable public electronic communications networks."
“distribution point” means a distribution point for a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network;
"the day on which a building notice, initial notice or public body’s notice relating to work to which this paragraph applies is given;"
the day on which full plans relating to building work to which this paragraph applies are deposited.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement RA1 for gigabit-ready physical infrastructure will be met by installing physical infrastructure or installations, including elements under joint ownership, to host wired or fixed wireless access networks that can do all of the following."
Facilitate a functioning connection to a gigabit capable public electronic communications network to each new dwelling.
Connect the building access point or common access point (where a building contains more than one dwelling) with a network termination point at each individual dwelling.
"Connect the network termination point with the physical point at which the network operator’s spine or core network ends (the network distribution point), or as close as is reasonably practicable where the developer has no right to install such infrastructure in land required to reach the distribution point."
"The network distribution point could be in a cabinet, a box mounted on a wall or on a telegraph pole."
It may or may not be on the development site.
Requirement RA1 for gigabit-ready physical infrastructure applies to the erection of a new dwelling or of a building that contains one or more dwellings.
A new dwelling may be a dwelling-house or a flat in a building that contains one or more dwellings.
New dwellings include the following:
"new dwellings in mixed-use developments (including live/work units, e.g. a flat (dwelling) that is a workplace for people who live there, and for people who do not live there)."
ready physical infrastructure.
In-building physical infrastructure is required from the common access point to the network termination points in each dwelling (see Diagram 6).
"In single-dwelling buildings, an access point is required as part of the gigabit-ready physical infrastructure (see Diagram 5)."
"Requirement RA1 does not apply to the following types of dwellings, buildings or building work."
Wholly non-residential buildings and existing buildings undergoing major renovation works.
New dwellings created through a material change of use.
"Rooms for residential purposes in hostels, hotels, boarding houses, schools and other educational establishments, and hospitals and other similar establishments used for patient accommodation."
"Buildings to be occupied by the Ministry of Defence or the armed forces of the Crown, or to be otherwise occupied for purposes connected to national security."
Buildings described in Schedule 2 (Exempt buildings and work) to the Building Regulations.
Buildings in areas isolated from a relevant public electronic communications network where both of the following apply.
The cost of providing a connection to a USO-standard public electronic communications network connection would exceed the cost cap (see paragraph 2.21).
"The prospect of a connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network, a high-speed public electronic communications network or a USO-standard public electronic communications network is too remote to justify equipping the building with gigabit-ready physical infrastructure or an access point."
"Where a developer seeks to rely on the building being in an ‘isolated area’ as a reason to exempt new dwellings from requirement RA1, the developer must provide evidence in support of the exemption."
"This should include an explanation of how new dwellings are in an area that is isolated from a relevant connection, that the cost of providing a USO-standard public electronic communications network connection exceeds the cost cap and why the prospect of a connection to a relevant network in the isolated area is considered too remote to justify equipping the building with the relevant gigabit-ready physical infrastructure."
The application of this exemption will vary in different circumstances.
This evidence can be provided with the information submitted with the application for Building Regulations approval.
"The connectivity plan at Appendix B, which sets out a template for developers, can be used to provide such evidence and information."
"Requirement RA1 requires that the developer installs gigabit-ready physical infrastructure from the network termination point to the network distribution point, where the developer has access rights over the relevant land (see Diagram 1)."
All the diagrams in this approved document (Diagrams 1 to 6) are simplified.
Developers should refer to specific guidance and the requirements of the Building Regulations when planning gigabit-ready physical infrastructure with network operators.
All the diagrams in this approved document (Diagrams 1 to 6) reflect full fibre gigabit-ready physical infrastructure.
"Where fixed wireless access or satellite technology is deployed, such infrastructure will be installed differently."
Diagrams 5 and 6 provide more detail on gigabit-ready physical infrastructure inside the dwelling.
"Where the developer does not have the right to extend the infrastructure to the distribution point, the developer is required to extend the infrastructure to the point that is as close as is reasonably practicable to the network distribution point (see Diagram 2)."
"For example, if there is a point that is as close to the distribution point as the developer can extend the gigabit-ready physical infrastructure to, but this would not be reasonably practicable for the developer due to the condition of the land in question, the infrastructure should be extended to an alternative point that is reasonably practicable."
Developers are encouraged to work with relevant network operators to identify suitable routes for such infrastructure.
"capable public electronic communications network is being provided because requirement RA2 is excluded or modified, and would be even if the gigabit-ready physical infrastructure was required to reach as close as is reasonably practicable to the distribution point, the developer is required to install the infrastructure to a point as close as is reasonably practicable to a location at which it reasonably expects a distribution point to be installed within the relevant 2-year period, i.e. a likely future location (see Diagram 3a)."
A developer will need to liaise with a network operator to ascertain the likely future location of a suitable network distribution point and provide evidence of having done so.
"Where a ducting system is being used, this is likely to be situated by the public highway."
The developer will need to provide evidence to a building control body of the steps undertaken to establish if an appropriate network distribution point is to be installed within the relevant 2-year period and where it is to be located.
Developers will also need to provide evidence of the steps undertaken should it be the case that there is no likely future location of an appropriate network distribution point within the relevant 2-year period.
Developers should ascertain this information from a network operator when inviting them to provide a relevant connection.
"Where there is no likely future location of a network distribution point that is closer to the dwelling than an existing distribution point and the developer cannot access land to a distant network distribution point, the developer is required to install infrastructure to an access point (see Diagram 3b)."
"Where there is no right to install gigabit-ready physical infrastructure in land beyond the building, the developer is required to install gigabit-ready physical infrastructure to an access point for an individual dwelling and to a common access point for buildings containing multiple dwellings (see Diagrams 4a and 4b)."

RA1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 1.16 A building control body will assess the particulars submitted by the developer in relation to the connection which is to be provided and any evidence provided in support of a reliance on any exemptions when considering whether building work has been completed within the requirements.
"The connectivity plan at Appendix B, which sets out a template for developers, can be used to provide such evidence and information."
"Street Works UK provides the following guidelines regarding groundworks infrastructure: Street Works UK Guidelines on the Positioning and Colour Coding of Underground Utilities’ Apparatus, Volume 1, Issue 9 [2018]. 1.17 The requirement to provide equipment such as an optical fibre cable or other technological means of facilitating a connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network (requirement RA2) is separate to requirement RA1."
Requirement RA1 relates to the installation of the infrastructure needed to host this equipment.
"To install gigabit-ready physical infrastructure to a network distribution point, developers will need to work closely with network operators."
"Where there is a choice of network distribution points, developers should work with network operators to choose which network distribution point would be appropriate and ascertain the corresponding location of the infrastructure."
Early engagement with network operators will help to ensure developers are aware of factors that may need mitigation – such as obstacles and terrain – that network operators may be able to assist with.
Developers should work with network operators from the earliest possible date.
"Where a ducting system is being used for installation of gigabit-ready physical infrastructure to a network distribution point, installation is likely to be to a point where the development site meets the public highway."
"Where a next fastest broadband connection or no connection to a public electronic communications network can be provided within the cost cap (see paragraphs 2.13 to 2.23), new dwellings must still be erected with gigabit-ready physical infrastructure installed to be ready to support a connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network in the future."
"In these cases, the gigabit-ready physical infrastructure is required to have sufficient capacity and dimensions to install and host a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network connection for each dwelling."
RA1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION a.
"RA1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 1.20 Once the infrastructure has been planned, developers should provide the required particulars to a building control body demonstrating how the proposed approach complies with requirement RA1 and whether any exemptions are to be relied upon."
Particulars provided by way of the connectivity plan would further assist the building control body if they contain evidence to demonstrate the location of gigabit-ready physical infrastructure.
"This could take the form of schematic diagrams, maps setting out the site layout and written evidence."
"One way to meet the requirement for gigabit-ready physical infrastructure which extends beyond the dwelling is to design and install a system of ducts, chambers, cabinets, towers and poles that can facilitate at least one gigabit-capable public electronic communications network connection for all the dwellings serviced by that infrastructure."
"In most cases, this requirement is likely to be met by infrastructure for full fibre connections (optical fibre cable from the dwelling to the network distribution point)."
"However, as the requirement is technologically neutral, any form of wired or wireless technologies that meet the performance requirements may be used."
"Where full fibre connections are not available, other means of providing gigabit-capable public electronic communications network connections – such as Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS 3.1) or a fixed wireless access technology – should be explored before pursuing a next fastest broadband connection."
The requirement does not preclude the voluntary installation of gigabit-ready physical infrastructure capable of supporting connections provided by multiple network operators or the installation of multiple forms of gigabit-ready physical infrastructure supporting multiple connections.
Further information about gigabit-ready physical infrastructure and gigabit-capable public electronic communications network connections is to be made available on the UK Government Digital Connectivity Portal at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-connectivity-portal.
"Where an access point is installed at a dwelling to facilitate connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network, the ingress of moisture into the building and air leakage from the building should be prevented."
Diagram 5 shows an example of gigabit-ready physical infrastructure for a single dwelling.
The access point is on an outside wall and is connected by a ‘through wall’ duct to the network termination point.
"For a building that contains more than one dwelling, such as a block of flats, a common access point and gigabit-ready physical infrastructure inside the building are required."
"Developers can also design and install a system of risers, floor boxes, cable trays and ducts from the common access point to each dwelling in the building."
See Diagram 6 for an example.
"point Gigabit-ready physical infrastructure (ducting) to the distribution point or, where there is no access right up to the distribution point, as close as is reasonably practicable to a distribution point."
"In some cases, there will be no gigabit-ready physical infrastructure beyond the access point."
"For a building that contains more than one dwelling, the gigabit-ready physical infrastructure inside the building should have sufficient capacity and dimensions to host at least one gigabit-capable public electronic communications network connection for each dwelling."
The gigabit-ready physical infrastructure inside a building should comply with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations.
"These include the requirements of Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations (Fire safety), including the need for fire stopping at penetrations through compartment walls, floors and ceilings, and the ban on combustible materials in the external walls of relevant buildings (regulation 7 of the Building Regulations)."
"Where a gigabit-capable connection is not installed pursuant to requirement RA2, the gigabit-ready physical infrastructure should be installed in such a way that it is protected from any deterioration resulting from exposure to the elements, so that it is ready to host connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network in the future."
"For example, ducting under land should be fully covered, and any infrastructure protruding from the building or ground should be encased where possible."
"Consideration should be given to the positioning of network termination points installed within the dwelling to ensure good connectivity throughout the dwelling, such as in central, open areas of the dwelling."
The Connected Home: Designing and Building Technology into Today’s New Homes [2016].
"Gigabit-ready physical infrastructure (ducting) to the distribution point or, where there is no access right up to the distribution point, as close as is reasonably practicable to a distribution point."
"In some cases, there will be no gigabit-ready physical infrastructure beyond the common access point."
This section deals with requirement RA2 from Part R of Schedule 1 and regulation 44ZC of the Building Regulations 2010.
Each dwelling must in addition be provided with a connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network.
The requirement in paragraph RA2 of Schedule 1 has effect subject to paragraphs (2) to (4).
"is able to secure the provision of a connection with a high-speed public electronic communications network for such a cost,"
paragraph RA2 of Schedule 1 is to be read as requiring the provision of a connection with a high-speed public electronic communications network.
"is able to secure the provision of a connection with a USO-standard public electronic communications network for such a cost,"
paragraph RA2 of Schedule 1 is to be read as requiring the provision of a connection with a USO-standard public electronic communications network.
"Where the developer is unable to secure the provision of a connection with a USO-standard public electronic communications network for a cost not exceeding the cost cap, paragraph RA2 of Schedule 1 does not apply."
“high-speed public electronic communications network” means a public electronic communications network that is a high-speed electronic communications network;
“USO-standard public electronic communications network” means a public electronic communications network that provides at least the minimum download speed for the time being specified by virtue of section 65(2B)(a) of the Communications Act 2003 in the universal service order (as defined by section 151(1) of that Act).
"the developer has invited at least two suitable providers to make, before the end of the 30th day after the date of the invitation, an offer to provide a connection of the kind mentioned in the paragraph in question, and"
none of those providers has before that time offered to provide that connection free of charge or at a cost not exceeding the cost cap.
"The cost cap is £2,000 in respect of each dwelling."
there is to be included value added tax;
"the cost to the developer of installing gigabit-ready physical infrastructure in accordance with paragraph RA1 of Schedule 1,"
"administrative costs of the developer, and"
the cost to an end-user (as defined by section 151(1) of the Communications Act 2003) of the provision of a public electronic communications service.
In paragraph (6)(a) “suitable provider” means the provider of a public electronic communications network whom the developer reasonably considers to be likely to be able to provide the connection referred to.
"In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement RA2 will be met by installing a relevant connection from a network distribution point to a network termination point at each new dwelling erected on a development site."
Requirement RA2 requires developers to install a functioning connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network but does not require developers to secure the provision of a public electronic communications service with an internet service provider.
Developers should work with network operators to provide a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network connection for each new dwelling erected unless the cost exceeds the cost cap of £2000 per dwelling or the network operator declines to provide a connection.
"Where a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network connection is not being installed because a connection is not offered within the £2000 cost cap, developers should work with network operators to provide the next fastest broadband connection which can be installed without exceeding the £2000 cost cap."
"Developers may decide to install, for each new dwelling erected, connections to more than one gigabit-capable public electronic communications network."
This can be done within one system of gigabit-ready physical infrastructure with capacity to host more than one type of connection.
"While developers may secure a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network connection from the first suitable network operator with which they engage, they may approach multiple network operators to secure multiple connections on a voluntary basis."
The connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network can be provided in the following ways.
Installing a suitable specification cable from the network termination point at each new dwelling erected on a development site to the network distribution point.
"Using wireless technologies, such as fixed wireless access, or satellite technologies, where they can support such a connection."
The technologies that can currently provide a connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network are set out in the most recent Ofcom Connected Nations report.
"The 2021 report sets out that relevant technologies include fibre to the premises (‘full fibre’, meaning optical fibre all the way to the dwelling) and other cable types, such as Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS 3.1) or Fixed Wireless Access (depending on the specific deployment, available capacity at the site, and the number and location of users)."
At least one network termination point should be provided in a suitable position at each new dwelling erected.
The network termination point is usually inside the dwelling in an open area.
Developers should consider the optimal location of the network termination point and the gigabit-ready physical infrastructure extending to it.
"In some dwellings, wireless coverage may not extend from the network termination point to all rooms in the dwelling."
Some developers may decide to include wired distribution within the dwelling at the time of construction to ensure good connectivity for residents.
The Connected Home: Designing and Building Technology into Today’s New Homes [2016].
VERSIONONLINE VERSION 2.7 A fixed electrical supply for the network termination point and associated distribution equipment should be provided at the network termination point.
The fixed electrical supply should comply with Part P in Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations (Electrical safety – dwellings).
"For new dwellings, the services and controls for the network termination point and fixed electrical supply, including socket outlets and switches, should be in a position which is easy to reach in accordance with the services and controls guidance supporting Part M in Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations (Access to and use of buildings)."
Requirement RA2 for a connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network applies to the erection of a new dwelling or of a building that contains one or more dwellings.
A new dwelling may be a dwelling-house or a flat in a building that contains one or more dwellings.
New dwellings include the following:
"new dwellings in mixed-use developments (including live/work units, e.g. a flat (dwelling) that is a workplace for people who live there, and for people who do not live there)."
"Requirement RA2 does not apply to the following types of dwellings, buildings or building work."
Wholly non-residential buildings and existing buildings undergoing major renovation works.
New dwellings created through a material change of use.
"Rooms for residential purposes in hostels, hotels, boarding houses, schools and other educational establishments, and hospitals and other similar establishments used for patient accommodation."
"Buildings to be occupied by the Ministry of Defence or the armed forces of the Crown, or to be otherwise occupied for purposes connected to national security."
Buildings described in Schedule 2 (Exempt buildings and work) to the Building Regulations.
Requirement RA2 does not apply if the cost of providing either a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network connection or each of the next fastest broadband connections would exceed the cost cap.
The cost cap for each dwelling is £2000 (see paragraphs 2.21 to 2.23).
"The developer should contact at least two suitable network operators, and provide evidence to demonstrate that an exemption applies where the offers from the suitable network operators exceed the cost cap."
"Where the developer has not invited two suitable network operators to provide such a connection, they will be treated as being able to secure the provision of that connection within the cost cap."
VERSIONONLINE VERSION 2.16 Evidence that the chosen network operators are suitable should be provided.
Developers will need to ensure the network operator is suitable for the purposes of requirement RA2.
"In determining which network operator is most likely to be able to provide the connection, the developer is encouraged to take into account factors such as the following:"
"other network operators, not necessarily in the locality of the development site, that might deploy there in the future."
"Where the cost of connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network exceeds the cost cap, connection to the next fastest broadband connection should be provided, in the following order of priority."
Connection to a high-speed electronic communications network.
Connection to a USO-standard public electronic communications network.
"As the requirements are technologically neutral, alternative technologies (such as fixed wireless or satellite technologies) should be considered where performance requirements can be met, before consideration is given to installing a slower form of connection."
Requirement RA1 to install gigabit-ready physical infrastructure at each individual dwelling still applies when new dwellings are erected without a connection or regardless of the speed of the connection installed at the point of construction.
"Requirement RA2 does not prescribe the method for developers to obtain offers and other relevant information from network operators, although there is a prescribed time limit of 30 working days for receipt of such offers."
a high-speed electronic communications network c. a USO-standard public electronic communications network.
"If the cost of connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network exceeds the cost cap, developers can consider the network operators’ quotes for the slower connections."
"The cost cap for the developer is £2000 for each new dwelling erected, after any financial contribution from the network operator has been deducted."
VERSIONONLINE VERSION 2.22 The following should be included in costs assessed against the cost cap.
Value added tax (VAT).
"The cost of providing a connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network or other relevant network, from the point of connection at the network termination point at each new dwelling erected on a development to the network distribution point."
Costs may include direct costs to the developer and costs to the developer of subcontracting to network operators.
The following are excluded from costs assessed against the cost cap.
"The cost to the developer of installing gigabit-ready physical infrastructure in relation to each dwelling erected, including infrastructure in common areas in a building containing more than one dwelling, in accordance with requirement RA1."
"Administrative costs of the developer, including costs of submitting the connectivity plan and building control body fees as applicable."
The cost to an end-user (as defined in section 151(1) of the Communications Act 2003) of the provision of a public electronic communications service.
Any financial contribution from the network operator should be deducted from the cost of providing the relevant connection.
"Before the relevant building work starts, when any relevant notice is provided or application is made to a building control body, the developer must provide certain additional information."
This includes particulars of any public electronic communications network to which a connection will be provided and evidence in support of relevant exemptions relied upon.
A model form connectivity plan is set out in Appendix B which the developer may use or adapt when providing such information.
Part A of the connectivity plan provides sections for the developer to demonstrate the location of the gigabit-ready physical infrastructure.
"This includes evidence demonstrating why such infrastructure is to be installed up to the point in question, which would be one of the following (as set out in paragraphs 1.8 to 1.15)."
From a network termination point to a network distribution point.
"Where the developer has no right over the land in question to reach a network distribution point, from a network termination point to a point as close as is reasonably practicable to a network distribution point."
"Where the developer has no right over the land in question to reach a network distribution point and requirement RA2 is excluded or modified, and would be so excluded or modified even if the gigabit-ready physical infrastructure were required to reach as close as is reasonably practicable to a network distribution point, to either of the following: i. a point as close as is reasonably practicable to a likely future location of a network distribution point location in the relevant 2-year period ii."
"where there is no likely future location that is closer than the closest network distribution point already installed, from a network termination point to the corresponding access point or common access point."
"Where the developer does not have access to land beyond the new dwelling, to an access point or common access point."
"RA1, RA2ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION 3.4 If an exemption is to be relied on for requirement RA1 or requirement RA2, Part B of the connectivity plan should also be completed and supporting evidence should be included with the connectivity plan when it is submitted."
The following information should be provided.
Evidence from at least two suitable network operators that demonstrates one of the following.
"The cost of providing a connection to a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network exceeds the cost cap, with accompanying quotes provided by the suitable network operators."
"The suitable network operators refused to provide a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network connection, and evidence demonstrating the reason for this refusal."
The suitable network operators have not responded within the 30 working day period.
Also provide evidence in support of any exemption relied upon for requirement RA1 to provide gigabit-ready physical infrastructure.
"Developers can consider which forms of evidence may most effectively support connectivity plan statements, which will vary between development sites."
"Written evidence, quotes and correspondence will be useful for some purposes."
Maps or diagrams may also be useful for indicating infrastructure routes and locations.
"Estimated timescales as to when infrastructure and connections are to be installed, which will also vary between development sites, are useful supporting evidence."
Requirements RA1 and RA2 do not oblige network operators to reply to developers where they are contacted for offers to provide a relevant connection.
"Developers may state in the connectivity plan, with supporting evidence, that at least two suitable network operators have declined to respond to the developer within the 30 working day period."
Network operators may also respond to decline to provide connections which the developer can provide as evidence in reliance on the exemption.
"Where an exemption is being relied on, Part B of the connectivity plan should be completed to provide one of the following."
Confirmation that the next fastest broadband connection that falls within the cost cap is being installed and include the relevant technical information.
"If no connection to any public electronic communications network is being provided, offers received from at least two suitable network operators confirming that they have refused to provide any connection to a public electronic communications network, or if no suitable network operator has responded within the 30 working day period, evidence to support this (see paragraph 2.20)."
"If a next fastest broadband connection or no connection is being installed, confirmation that gigabit-ready physical infrastructure will still be installed from each new dwelling erected on the development site to one of the points listed in order of priority, as set out in paragraphs 1.8 to 1.15."
"In addition to the information and particulars required of them under requirements RA1 and RA2, developers must provide all additional required information and particulars when making an application for Building Regulations approval."

major renovation works to buildings.
"ready in-building physical infrastructure, up to a network termination point for high-speed electronic communications networks."
"Where the work concerns a building containing more than one dwelling, the work must be carried out so as to ensure that the building is equipped in addition with a common access point for high-speed electronic communications networks."
"In the Secretary of State’s view, a building will meet requirement R1 if it is designed and constructed so that high-speed electronic communications networks can be installed in the future."
"Requirement R1 applies to new buildings and to existing buildings that are subject to major renovation works, including existing dwellings subject to such works."
See paragraph 1.5 for types of building and building work that are exempt.
"Requirement R1 does not apply where requirement RA1 applies, e.g. when a new dwelling or a building containing one or more dwellings is erected."
"Requirement R1 is to provide the in-building physical infrastructure so that, in future, copper or fibre-optic cables or wireless devices capable of delivering broadband speeds greater than 30 Mbps can be installed."
"A standard copper telephone cable, when connected to a service provider’s fibre network, can deliver broadband speeds up to 70 Mbps."
"The requirement is to provide only the in-building physical infrastructure, from the service provider’s access point to the occupier’s network termination point."
Multi-dwelling buildings that are subject to major renovation works must be equipped with a common access point capable of serving all the dwellings within the building.
"It is not a requirement to provide any network cabling or equipment, or any in-building physical infrastructure that extends internally beyond the network termination point."
Nor is it a requirement to provide any external or site-wide infrastructure beyond the access point or common access point.
The developer and broadband service provider should agree who will install such external infrastructure.
Requirement R1 does not apply to the following types of building or building work.
The erection of a new dwelling described in requirements RA1 and RA2 for gigabit-ready physical infrastructure and gigabit-capable connections (see Approved Document R Volume 1: Physical infrastructure and network connection for new dwellings).
house or a flat in a building that contains one or more dwellings.
Dwellings include the following:
"new dwellings in mixed-use developments (including live/work units, e.g. a flat (dwelling) that is a workplace for people who live there, and for people who do not live there)."
"Buildings and work described in Classes 2 to 7 of Schedule 2 (Exempt buildings and work) to the Building Regulations – for example, sheds, domestic greenhouses, garages, conservatories and other small detached buildings with no sleeping accommodation."
R1ONLINE VERSIONONLINE VERSION c. Buildings included in the schedule of monuments maintained under section 1 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.
Buildings for which compliance with requirement R1 would unacceptably alter their character or appearance and that are either of the following:
in a conservation area designated in accordance with section 69 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.
"Buildings occupied by the Ministry of Defence or the armed forces of the Crown, or otherwise occupied for purposes connected to national security."
Buildings in isolated areas where the prospect of a high-speed connection is considered too remote to justify equipping the building with high-speed-ready in-building physical infrastructure or an access point or common access point.
"For example, areas that are so isolated that no duty is placed on a communications provider (under the Electronic Communications (Universal Service) Order 2003) to meet the full cost of installing a telephone line to the building."
Major renovation works if the cost of compliance with requirement R1 would be disproportionate to the benefit gained.
"A person wishing to take advantage of this exemption would need to demonstrate to a building control body that in the particular case the cost of compliance would be unreasonable, taking into account the work required and the available alternative means of high-speed broadband delivery."
"A suitable position for at least one network termination point should be identified for the erection of a new building other than a dwelling, for an existing building (including an existing individual dwelling) that is subject to major renovation works, and for each dwelling in an existing multi-dwelling building that is subject to major renovation works."
Suitable ducting should be provided to connect all such network termination points to an appropriate access point or common access point.
Diagram 11 shows a possible arrangement for the physical infrastructure for a single-occupancy building.
The access point is on an outside wall and is connected by a through-wall duct2 to a network termination point.
"The diagrams show underground ducts for network cables outside the building, but this does not preclude the use of overhead lines."
"For copper cables, the duct may simply be a hole drilled in the wall."
Note the downwards slope to the outside to prevent rainwater ingress.
The diagram shows future connectivity by underground ducts for network cables outside the building.
"However, it should be noted that alternative forms of connectivity may be used."
A multi-dwelling building subject to major renovation works should have a common access point and dedicated vertical and horizontal service routes so that service providers can connect from the common access point to the network termination point in each dwelling.
Diagram 2 shows a possible arrangement for the physical infrastructure for a multi-dwelling building.
The in-building physical infrastructure should comply with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations.
"These include the requirements of Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations (Fire safety), including the need for fire stopping at penetrations through compartment walls, floors and ceilings, and the ban on combustible materials in the external walls of relevant buildings (regulation 7 of the Building Regulations)."
The diagram shows future connectivity by underground ducts for network cables outside the building.
"However, it should be noted that alternative forms of connectivity may be used."
use multi-unit buildings.
The requirement is for the common access point to serve each of the dwellings within the building.
"Other units may also use the common access point, or they may have an entirely separate in-building physical infrastructure."
The design of the in-building physical infrastructure should take account of satellite and wireless technologies where there is evidence that the required network speeds could be met.
"Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 2016, Next generation access for new build homes – Guide, provides best practice guidance on infrastructure and cabling for broadband networks in new homes."
"Developers should refer to PAS 2016 and manufacturers’ specifications for guidance on the duct dimensions, bending radii etc. required to allow copper and fibre optic cables to be installed in the future."

This section deals with requirement S1 from Part S of Schedule 1 and regulation 44D of the Building Regulations 2010.
A new residential building with associated parking must have access to electric vehicle charge points as provided for in paragraph (2).
"the total number of associated parking spaces, where there are fewer associated parking spaces than there are dwellings contained in the residential building; or"
"the number of associated parking spaces that is equal to the total number of dwellings contained in the residential building, where there are the same number of associated parking spaces as, or more associated parking spaces than, there are dwellings."
a new residential building has more than 10 associated parking spaces; and
there are more associated parking spaces than there are dwellings contained in the residential building.
The requirements of paragraph S1 of Schedule 1 apply in relation to the erection of a new residential building with associated parking as follows.
The number of electric vehicle charge points that must be installed is the maximum number of electric vehicle charge points that it is possible to install at an average sum of £3600 or less for the connection cost of each electric vehicle charge point connection (“the £3600 cap”).
"If it is not possible to completely fulfil the requirements of paragraph S1(2) of Schedule 1 as a result of the operation of the £3600 cap, cable routes for electric vehicle charge points must be installed in the associated parking spaces that would otherwise be required to have electric vehicle charge points, but for the operation of the £3600 cap."
"(aa) the number of parking spaces in the covered car park which, when added to the number of associated parking spaces which are situated in a position other than in the covered car park, corresponds to the total number of dwellings with associated parking, where the total number of associated parking spaces is 10 or less;"
"(bb) all the associated parking spaces in the covered car park, where the total number of associated parking spaces is both less than the number of dwellings with associated parking and 10 or less; and"
"(cc) all the associated parking spaces in the covered car park, where the total number of associated parking spaces is more than 10;"
(aa) in the number of associated parking spaces in the covered car park which corresponds to the total number of dwellings with associated parking;
(bb) in all the parking spaces where there are fewer parking spaces than there are dwellings;
"in all the parking spaces in the covered car park, where there are more than 10 parking spaces."
Regulations 2010 (as amended).
"In the Secretary of State’s view, requirement S1 and regulation 44D are met if building work complies with all the following."
"For a new residential building where requirement S1 applies (paragraph 1.4), electric vehicle charge points are installed in accordance with paragraph 1.1."
"For new residential buildings where both of the following conditions apply, cable routes are installed."
The requirement to install electric vehicle charge points does not apply to all associated parking spaces (paragraph 1.4).
The building has more than 10 associated parking spaces.
"Where associated parking spaces are provided for a new residential building, the number of associated parking spaces that have access to an electric vehicle charge point must be a minimum of either of the following."
The number of associated parking spaces.
The number of dwellings that the car park serves.
See paragraphs 1.4 to 1.7 for the application of these requirements.
"Where no associated parking spaces are provided, there is no requirement to install an electric vehicle charge point."
"If some associated parking spaces are not required to install electric vehicle charge points following paragraphs 1.4 to 1.7, then cable routes may need to be installed."
the total number of associated parking spaces which have access to either an electric vehicle charge point or cable routes must be a minimum of either of the following.
The number of associated parking spaces.
The number of dwellings that the car park serves.
cable routes must be provided for all associated parking spaces which do not have access to an electric vehicle charge point.
The requirement to install electric vehicle charge points set out in paragraph 1.1 applies for each associated parking space where both of the following apply.
The associated parking space is not within a covered car park.
"The average connection cost for each electric vehicle charge point connection is less than £3600, determined according to paragraph 1.5."
Diagram 1.1 and Diagram 1.2 give examples of determining which parking spaces are associated parking spaces.
"On a new development, multiple residential buildings, landscaping, roads etc. may be under the same ownership."
The diagrams give examples of more complex site boundary scenarios.
"Parking space 1, despite being separated from dwelling 1 by a garden, is within the site boundary and contains a parking space associated with dwelling 1."
Parking space 2 is within the site boundary of dwelling 1 and contains a parking space associated with dwelling 1.
Parking space 3 is outside the site boundary of dwelling 1.
"In this example, parking space 3 is separated from dwelling 1 by a public highway or a road that does not belong to the owners of dwelling 1."
"Garage/Car port 1 is within the site boundary of dwelling 1, despite being separated from the building by a garden; therefore, parking space within the garage/car port is associated with dwelling 1."
"Note that some garages do not contain parking spaces (for example, if a car cannot reasonably be expected to be parked inside the garage)."
Parking space 4 is outside the site boundary of dwelling 1.
Parking space 4 is on land that belongs to the owners of dwelling 2.
Car park 1 is within the site boundary for building 1 and contains parking spaces associated with building 1.
"Car park 2 is outside the site boundary, and the parking spaces do not therefore need to be considered."
The car park may be associated with a different building or under different ownership to building 1.
"Car park 3, despite being separated from building 1 by vegetation/landscaping, is within the site boundary."
"If the parking spaces are for the use of the occupants/users of building 1, they are therefore associated with building 1."
Car park 4 is outside the site boundary of building 1.
"In this example, the car park is separated from the building by a public highway or a road under different ownership to that of the building."
The on-street parking is outside the site boundary of the building.
"In this example, the parking spaces are on a public highway or a road that does not belong to the owners of the building."
Car park 1 and car park 3 each contain seven parking spaces.
The new building therefore has 14 associated parking spaces.
The requirements for buildings with a minimum of 11 associated parking spaces apply.
VERSIONONLINE VERSION 1.5 The connection cost for installing an electric vehicle charge point is the extra cost of the incoming electrical supply per electric vehicle charge point connection compared to the cost without electric vehicle charge points.
"Where the connection cost is greater than £3600 per electric vehicle charge point connection, the maximum number of electric vehicle charge points should be installed before the extra grid connection costs exceed £3600 per electric vehicle charge point connection."
"On a site where multiple new dwellings are planned (for example, where they are within the same notice/plans) an average connection cost may be used."
To show that the connection cost is greater than £3600 at least two formal quotes should be given to the building control body during the notice/plans stage as follows.
At least one quote should be from a distribution network operator.
Quotes should clearly show all of the following.
"The total connection costs for electrical infrastructure without electric vehicle charge points for all dwellings, as an average cost per dwelling."
"The total connection costs with electric vehicle charge points for all dwellings, as an average cost per dwelling."
The average additional connection costs per electric vehicle charge point per dwelling if electric vehicle charge points are installed for all dwellings with associated parking spaces.
The maximum number of electric vehicle charge points that can be installed before the extra grid connections costs exceed £3600 per charge point per dwelling.
This section deals with requirement S2 from Part S of Schedule 1 and regulation 44E of the Building Regulations 2010.
"Where one or more dwellings with associated parking result from a building, or a part of a building, undergoing a material change of use at least one associated parking space for the use of each such dwelling must have access to an electric vehicle charge point."
"The requirements of paragraph S2 of Schedule 1 apply to a building, or a part of a building, undergoing a material change of use to result in one or more dwellings as follows."
"the circumstances specified in regulation 5(a), (b) or (g) apply; and"
"(aa) to a car park that is located within the site boundary of the building, where the nature of the work is such that it would be reasonable to expect that work to include enabling the requirements of paragraph S2 of Schedule 1 to be fulfilled;"
"(bb) the electrical infrastructure of a car park, where that car park is located within the site boundary of the building;"
"(cc) the electrical infrastructure of the building, where a car park is located inside the building;"
"subject to paragraph (3), if an electric vehicle charge point for each dwelling resulting from a building, or a part of a building, undergoing a material change of use can be accommodated within the incoming electrical supply to the building without having to upgrade the capacity of the incoming electrical supply to the building; and"
if the building is not one in relation to which paragraph (4) applies.
the requirements of paragraph S2 of Schedule 1 apply in respect of the maximum number of electric vehicle charge points that can be accommodated within the incoming electrical supply; and
cable routes for electric vehicle charge points must be installed in the associated parking spaces that would otherwise have been required under paragraph S2 of Schedule 1 to have had electric vehicle charge points installed.
